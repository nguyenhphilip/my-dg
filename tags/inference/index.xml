An effect size is a standardized measurement that compares the size of some statistical effect to a reference quantity, such as the variability of the statistic.
why they&amp;rsquo;re useful They are a standardized metric (scale free) that enables comparison (e.g. meta analysis) and communication of results using effect sizes from prior studies is useful for planning new studies via statistical power by providing an indication of what sample size is necessary to observe a statistically significant result two families: D and r Effect sizes can be grouped in two families (Rosenthal, 1994): The d family (consisting of ==standardized mean differences==) and the r family (measures of ==strength of association==).</description></item></channel></rss>
