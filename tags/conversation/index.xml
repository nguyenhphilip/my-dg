The topic last night was “The Immigrant Experience”, incredibly timely given the circumstances: what does it mean to be an immigrant? An expat? An émigré? We discussed open borders; finding vs. building a sense of home; identity as a shifting panorama shaped by one’s context; that unsettling feeling of in-betweenness as a spur for creativity and a sign of internal dialogue seeking resolution; beliefs and disillusion; immigrant optimism and the desire for a better life as buoys that have the strength to propel their lives and the country forward; our common humanity; redefining and striving toward American and Western ideals.</description></item></channel></rss>
