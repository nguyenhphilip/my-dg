I’m a 28-year-old woman who has only dated one person, a man 14 years older than me, for over six years in my early 20s. I haven’t been with anyone else before or after that, apart from kissing a few people I’ve met on dating apps. Those dates never went anywhere, mostly mutually. It’s been over two years now, and I’m starting to feel like something’s got to change if I’m ever going to be close to anyone again.</description></item><item><title>How Are You Difficult to Live With</title><link>https://nguyenhphilip.github.io/notes/relationships/How-Are-You-Difficult-to-Live-With/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nguyenhphilip.github.io/notes/relationships/How-Are-You-Difficult-to-Live-With/</guid><description>How Are You Difficult to Live with? The idea that one is in many ways an extremely difficult person to be in a relationship with may sound rather improbable and even at points offensive.

There are few people more deeply insufferable than those who don’t, at regular intervals, suspect they might be so.</description></item></channel></rss>
