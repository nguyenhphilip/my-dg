title: Wishing Well
---

What’s a chance encounter in a city that’s never left you?

In this [Poem](notes/Poems/Poems-directory.md) the speaker is asked a question by a stranger while standing near the water outside the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. “Pardon me Old School he / says you know is this a wishing well?” He initially brushes off the stranger, but something happens: a shared coin, a well, a wish that is answered as it is made.

> Outside the Met a man walks up sun
> tweaking the brim sticker on his Starter cap
> and he says pardon me Old School he
> says you know is this a wishing well?
> Yeah Son I say sideways over my shrug.
> Throw your bread on the water.
> I tighten my chest wheezy as Rockaway beach
> sand with a pull of faux smoke from my e-cig
> to cozy the truculence I hotbox alone
> and I am at the museum because it is not a bar.
> Because he appears not to have changed
> them in days I eye the heel-chewed hems
> of his pants and think probably he will
> ask me for fifty cents any minute now wait
> for it. A smoke or something. Central Park displays
>
> the frisking transparency of autumn. Tracing
> paper sky, leaves like eraser crumbs gum
> the pavement. As if deciphering celestial
> script I squint and purse off toward the roof
> line of the museum aloof as he fists two
> pennies from his pockets mumbling and then
> aloud my man he says hey my man I’m going
> to make a wish for you too.
> I am laughing now so what you want
> me to sign a waiver? He laughs along ain’t
> say all that he says but you do have to
> hold my hand.             And close your eyes.
> I make a starless night of my face before
> he asks are you ready. Yeah dawg I’m ready.
> Sure? Sure let’s do this his rough hand
> in mine inflates like a blood pressure cuff and I
> squeeze back as if we are about to step together
> from the sill of all resentment and timeless
> toward the dreamsource of un-needing the two
> of us hurtle sharing the cosmic breast
> of plenitude when I hear the coins blink against
> the surface and I cough up daylight like I’ve just
> been dragged ashore. See now
> you’ll never walk alone he jokes and is about
> to hand me back to the day he found me in
> like I was a rubber duck and he says you got to let
> go but I feel bottomless and I know he means
> well though I don’t believe
> and I feel myself shaking
> my head no when he means let go his hand.”
