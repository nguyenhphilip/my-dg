> Wait, for now.
> Distrust everything if you have to.
> But trust the hours. Haven't they carried you everywhere, up to now?
> Personal events will become interesting again.
> Hair will become interesting. Pain will become interesting.
> Buds that open out of season will become
> interesting. Second-hand gloves will become lovely again;
> their memories are what give them the need for other hands. The desolation 
> of lovers is the same: that enormous emptiness carved out of such
> tiny beings as we are
> asks to be filled; the need
> for the new love is faithfulness to the old.
> Wait.
> Don't go too early.
> You're tired. But everyone's tired. But no one is tired enough.
> Only wait a little and listen:
> music of hair,
> music of pain,
> music of looms weaving our loves again. Be there to hear it, it
> will be the only time, most of all to hear your whole existence,
> rehearsed by the sorrows, play itself into total
> exhaustion.
