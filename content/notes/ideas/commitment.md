# Via Sasha, 2020-12-25:
- Phil by doing research you will get a good job. if you do easy random jobs like teaching English you are losing time. You need to get material stability as priority. Then you will see your creative powers can blossom. These few years I suggest you to focus on down to earth career. So you have food and means to travel. And also it will teach you a lot. This earthy path.
- You are soo young and can change your specialisation after 10 years.
- that is a sign. yes you can try to excel in one area. even if it feels narrow path. try it.  it will help you a lot. 
- Phil you are so awesomely talented...i am amazed by your way of thinking and your abilities every time...as if i watch amazing wonderbird in flight up high. breathtaking. and i see your potential is immense.
- it is no that i was born and dreamed instantly to become hydrogeologist. i chose it because it is good for environment, it is useful and challenging / hidden enough so not many people burn with desire to do it.
- yes share your thoughts on it. i shared mine and i will respect your viewpoint
- from the start i had my tiny fishbowl to live in. so my possibilities are not as wide as yours. 
- strangely i love my limitations.
- studying was hard for me but it made me happy
- but it also made me sad angry anxious painful numb tired and at some point i was sick of it. the good part looking back i realised that all of it was road to happiness. 
- overcoming oneself is worth doing, but i guess you are not looking for simply more pleasant things to do. you are in search of [meaning](notes/ideas/meaning.md)
- if i look at it from [meaning](notes/ideas/meaning.md) point of view. my hobbies are more meaningful to me. my hydrogeology modelling path on its own tastes like water..  salt of my life is arts humane connection and things i can give to others
- but i need that tasteless hydrogeology bit because it gives me stability, bread and confidence, means to do things that matter more
- and hydrogeology can be complex enough, it challenges my brain, makes me think. it is wide so i can focus on different areas. 

# On marriage
- via [school of life](notes/mental-health/school-of-life.md)
	- the main assumption: following our every impulse is not always the best choice. True in the context of [relationships](notes/relationships/relationships.md); we will inevitably feel sad, frustrated, and lonely as is human nature, even and especially within a relationship. seeking escape from these feelings can often take the form of looking elsewhere, in someone else, for temporary relief. and yet this is often counter-conducive to what we truly want and care about.
	- "chances of development can increase hugely when we stay put and don't succumb to the temptation to run away to people who will falsely reassure us that there's nothing too wrong with us"
	- "What we are correctly now focused on is the psychological point of making it hard to throw in the towel. In turns out that we benefit greatly (though at a price) from having to stick with certain commitments, **because some of our key needs have a long-term structure.**" 
	- For the last fifty years, the burden of intelligent effort has been on attempting to make separation easier. The challenge now lies in another direction: **in trying to remind ourselves why immediate flight doesn't always make sense; in trying to see the point of holding out for the second marshmallow.**"
	- Tethering ourselves to our partner, via the public institution of marriage, makes our unavoidable fluctuations of feeling have less power to destroy a relationship, one that we know, in calmer moments, is supremely important to us. The point of marriage is to be usefully unpleasant – at least at crucial times. Together we embrace a set of limitations on one kind of freedom, the freedom to run away, so as to protect and strengthen another kind, the shared ability to mature and create something of lasting value, the pains of which are aligned to our better selves.""

# Sam Harris on [gratitude](notes/ideas/gratitude.md), 2020-12-26
- A moment of reflection on the things you have, and how what we want changes once we get the things we once wanted. Sam asks us to recognize how the goal post always moves, and to simply accept that what we have truly is enough, in this moment. he also asks us to reinvite that sense we previously had when we didn't have what we now do. this has the effect of making us feel more thankful for our lives.
- recognize that your life is enough in this moment.
- for myself and my own life:
	- my relationships
		- Sasha
		- Mandy
		- Mom & Dad
		- Paulina
		- Andrew
		- Eszter
		- Alyona
		- El
	- friends who bought my first poetry collection
	- the chance to be practically useful and to do research via [ABCD Study](notes/ABCD/ABCD-Study.md) and the Complex Systems program
	- learning guitar
	- a cozy, comfortable apartment in the lovely Burlington, Vermont
	- books and the opportunity to enrich my inner (and by extension outer) life

on abandoning unhappiness 2018-02-18:  Our current unhappiness is often times the result of choosing to be unhappy. If we know that we are unhappy, and we don’t want to feel this way, then we must choose to be someone and do something else. With that comes leaving behind our comfortable shells, one that most people would rather stay in than to abandon, despite the obvious misery it is causing. courage is necessary. Courage is what prompts us to take the first step, it is usually the hardest one to take. Commitment is the next.

finding newness and excitement not by chasing the 'honeymoon' and 'shock' of starting over, but by savoring and deepening your relationship and ties to things you already have.
