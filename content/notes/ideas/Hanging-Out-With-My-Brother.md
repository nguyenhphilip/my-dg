"Hell is other people, but life is other people if you care about them enough."

The main character in red is shown chatting with his brother in blue about what's bothering him. He has been working on a theory of the [[meaning of life]]. It describes the [[self]] as dependent on our relationship with others; it's all connected. There's a notion of distance in his diagram of these interconnected relationships, which he claims doesn't matter as much as their quality. That is to say, how these people affected us is what we remember - who we are is what we remember. The essential mindfuck of this episode, the twist, is that the brother is dead, and his theory is, in a sense, the red brother's way of coming to terms with this more generally. To him, it doesn't matter that his brother is dead, because he still lives on in his conscious mind; his voice, his imagined self construed from who he once was, that is what makes him alive now.
