Rooms, Abodes, Flats, Apartments

What it's like to step into another person's room. It's the most intimate space of our lives, it's our home and our mess, our shelter and our it's ours. What are we doing when we invite someone in, to what are we inviting them to? A portal into our lives. It is a way of seeing who someone without necessarily engaging with them. When we meet and converse with someone, when we get to know them, we usually only give elevator pitches and summaries. And even with someone we're comfortable with, someone who we can say is our close friend, there are details lost or omitted. Seeing someone's room, apartment, and home is one step beyond that. They're details, intricacy, nuance. They're the parts of us we normally don't reveal and talk about, yet are a part of us all the same.
