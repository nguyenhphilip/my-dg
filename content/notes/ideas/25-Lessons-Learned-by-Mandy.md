# 25 Lessons Learned by Mandy

I wrote these thoughts about turning twenty-five this year, and realized both how far I have come and how much I have left to learn. This blog is meant to be my creative outlet, and also want to be able to read the pieces I wrote in the future and see growth. If I don’t look back at these and cringe a little in five years, I am living my life wrong :). I hope you enjoy this list and that it makes you think about how far you have come, no matter your age.

1. Twenty-five really isn’t even that old. Let go of the timeline in your head and trust the process and progression of your life.
2. Clear skin does not give you clarity; clear skin does not make you more or less. Acne does not make you awful–it makes you human. Think less about how you look and more about who you are and what you stand for.
3. A support system is not just good; it’s necessary. We all need people on our side that have our backs. Lift people up and the load we carry together becomes lighter.
4. Intention and curiosity are the key ingredients to meaningful and fulfilling relationships. If you continue to make an effort to get to know those you [love](notes/ideas/love.md) as they grow and you invest time and energy in your loved ones, you will feel connected to others, and to humanity in general.
5. Self-discipline is the difference between real and imagined success.
6. Keep reading and writing. It’s never wasted time to learn or to enjoy.
7. Cooking real recipes is incredibly healing for your relationship to your health.
8. You’ll only regret the sunscreen you don’t put on.
9. Call people on the phone more. Just do it–it will feel good. ^3d370f
10. Learn to say no without explaining yourself.
11. Forgiveness is a gift that you can give to yourself, but it is a process that cannot be rushed. Master the art of giving yourself closure–it is not a wish that someone else can grant you.
12. Love people in a way that makes them feel free to be themselves, unapologetically.
13. Your dreams can be so big that you pray about them. Faith is not linear and it’s okay to have questions.
14. People will doubt you, so try not to waste so much time doubting yourself. You have a voice, so share it. Rejection is a fact of a well-lived life; keep moving forward.
15. Sometimes you have to let people go and love them from afar. It doesn’t mean you gave up on them; it means you are protecting the peace and the life you are building.
16. Travel and education are investments in your well being and life experience.
17. Do not let the pandemic make you distant from the humanity of others; hold the humanity of others close. Turn toward people.
18. Needing alone time to recharge doesn’t make you lame. Take the time you need to feel energized so that you can be present when you are with other people.
19. Make time for art and make time to play. Play music and sing, not for the world to hear you, but for you to feel joy. And dance more–a lot more.
20. Don’t seek advice or to give advice. Seek connection and listen to understand.
21. Journal your life, but don’t just write down the big things. The little things and the way you feel in small, meaningful moments are the things you will want to carry forever.
22. Try not to edit people’s Instagram posts. No one cares that much about typos :).
23. Sleep more and worry less.
24. How you spend your money matters; understand your impact on the environment, communities, and people. Not everyone values profit over people–find those exceptions and support them.
25. Your patience and your empathy do not make you weak. They make you strong.
