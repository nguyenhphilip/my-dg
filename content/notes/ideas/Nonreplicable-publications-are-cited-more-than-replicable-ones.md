> Three influential replication projects ([_5_](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/21/eabd1705#ref-5)–[_7_](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/21/eabd1705#ref-7)) tried to systematically replicate the findings in top psychology, economics, and general science journals. In psychology, only 39% of the experiments yielded significant findings in the replication study, compared to 97% of the original experiments. In economics, 61% of 18 studies replicated, and among _Nature/Science_ publications, 62% of 21 studies.

> In addition, the relative effecteffect sizes of findings that did replicate were only 75% of the original ones. For failed replications, they were close to 0% \[see also ([_8_](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/21/eabd1705#ref-8)–[_10_](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/21/eabd1705#ref-10))\].

> Our main finding is that papers that fail to replicate in ([_5_](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/21/eabd1705#ref-5)–[_7_](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/21/eabd1705#ref-7)) are cited more than those that are replicable. We find no significant change in citation trends, even after the publication of the failed replication. Notably, only a minority of publications after the failed replications were published acknowledge the failure. The “quality” of citations of papers that failed to replicate is similar to that of papers that were replicated: We do not find a difference in how often the citations of nonreplicable publications are cited by others or in the impact factor of the journals in which citations are published.
