Last night I participated in a 3 hour online salon hosted by The Interintellect, a group of friendly internet patrons from all around the world who enjoy nerding out and talking about ideas. The topic last night was “The Immigrant Experience”, incredibly timely given the circumstances: what does it mean to be an immigrant? An expat? An émigré? We discussed open borders; finding vs. building a sense of home; identity as a shifting panorama shaped by one’s context; that unsettling feeling of in-betweenness as a spur for creativity and a sign of internal dialogue seeking resolution; [beliefs](notes/ideas/belief.md) and disillusion; immigrant [optimism](notes/ideas/optimism.md) and the desire for a better life as buoys that have the strength to propel their lives and the country forward; our common humanity; redefining and striving toward American and Western ideals. Everyone was incredibly open, kind, and had skin in this game of ideas. It renewed my sense of hope and my belief in people, and it emphasized the value of putting optimism to action.
