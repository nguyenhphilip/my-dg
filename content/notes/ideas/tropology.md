what are stories?

- brain as "story processor" via The Righteous Mind
- stories are about change (Gerald Prince 2009, Speech and Language Processing)
	- three parts:
		- a starting state (the beginning)
		- events that move the story from the beginning to the end
		- an ending state (the ending)

purpose of stories?

- efficient information processing via tropes/agreed upon meanings, culture ([Friston Free Energy Principle](notes/neuro/Friston-Free-Energy-Principle.md)?)
- ward off meaninglessness of existence
- transmission of values

elements of stories?
- story characters
- plot
- time
- behavior

What makes it hard for a machine to tell a story? Or to understand one? In **Modeling Protagonist Emotions for Emotion-Aware Storytelling**, the paper isn't really about the nature of stories, it instead tests different models of generating stories that track the emotions of the protagonist. But what does that say about stories themselves? This is more a paper on modeling than stories.
