- What are tropes and why should we study and understand them?
    - We are storytelling/[meaning](notes/ideas/meaning.md)-making creatures that use various methods of abstraction (stories, metaphors, [Poems](notes/Poems/Poems-directory.md), math) to represent and reason about our experiences and the world.
	- **tropes** are particular abstractions with generally agreed upon meanings used to convey and facilitate the communication of ideas within the structure of some larger/collective narrative, which itself can be viewed as a trope (the story of being human, the story of being a human with other humans, the story of being a citizen under US democracy â€“ i.e. Julia and turtles all the way down)
	- Modeling society in this way can allow us to gain insight into our own present and future thought processes and behavior if we assume that individuals and groups of people act in ways that correlate with specific tropes.
	- Can we classify certain high profile individuals as fitting a specific trope?
		- This thought was inspired by a podcast I was listening to that called our president a tyrant. 

	- **Uses of tropes**:
		- packaging many ideas together in a more digestable format
		- understanding the context of a situation without needing to know the details
		- use of above to persuade and steer direction of conversation
		- shape trajectory of personal and collective narrative (beliefs, culture, and society)

	- **Some questions:**
		- Studying tropes seems akin to studying how ideas shape a system
		- can we predict the future state of a system based on the the actors (individual tropes) and the structures (meta tropes) that define it?
			-  do stories defined by similar sets of meta and individual tropes follow the same developmental arc i.e. have the same or similar outcomes? 
				-  If not, why? 
					-  If everything points to being doomed, what might steer the trajectory in a different direction, despite evidence to the contrary?
						-  luck? randomness? a lone hero or rebellious group of individuals? the presence of lesser-known, but highly influential actors? 
						-  things we've yet to tropify or are untropifable?
			-  What are the most important components of this story?
				- when do the details matter; when does the whole outweigh the collective action of the parts?
			- How similar is a real world actor (e.g. Donald Trump) to a particular trope (e.g. The Tyrant, The Dictator) and in what kind of story/narrative do they operate under? are they more powerful in certain regimes/meta stories than in other ones?
		- When tropes seem to compete against each other, is the resolution a more nuanced winner? Or a new trope?
		- are more popular tropes more convincing / better representations of the phenomena they depict?
			- are stories that consist of these tropes more effective in persuading/shaping public opinion? (e.g. part of political campaigning seems to be about creating a story that people feel they can get behind)

		-  sometimes tropes can be too general or miss important details about certain phenomena, and therefore potentially misused/abused


- Are most edits from moderators or members? Does it depend on the popularity of the trope?
