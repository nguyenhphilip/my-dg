title: The Green New Deal

## Summary

> Introduced by Representative [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/11/nyregion/aoc-mayor-nyc.html) of New York and Senator Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts, both Democrats, ==the proposal calls on the federal government to wean the United States from fossil fuels and curb planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions across the economy==. It also aims to ==guarantee new high-paying jobs in clean energy industries==.

## Main provisions

> It says the entire world needs to get to net-zero emissions by 2050 (The Paris Agreement) — meaning as much carbon would have to be absorbed as released into the atmosphere — and the United States must take a “leading role” in achieving that. 
> To achieve those goals, the plan calls for the launch of a “10-year mobilization” to reduce carbon emissions in the United States. It envisions sourcing 100 percent of the country’s electricity from renewable and zero-emissions power, digitizing the nation’s power grid, upgrading every building in the country to be more energy-efficient, and overhauling the nation’s transportation systems by investing in electric vehicles and high-speed rail.
