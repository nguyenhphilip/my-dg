Kant was a moral absolutist, in the sense that he believed there to be a consistent, almost mathematical morality that was to be followed if one wanted to be a moral human being. 

(However he made the distinction between doing things for moral reasons and for other non-moral reasons)

# Hypothetical Imperatives
If-then commands you _should_ follow in order to satisfy some desire. Not exactly about morality.

# Categorical Imperative
You _have_ to follow these imperatives, regardless of desires. These imperatives are derived from pure reason.

How to derive them? Formulations, different ways of looking at the same problem. In this case it's implied that there are universal rules that can be derived through reason and must be followed.

## Formulation 1: The Universality Principle
Rules, maxims, laws that must be followed in the same fashion in any circumstance or situation. 

If there are contradictions between the maxim behind the action and the action itself – e.g. you believe stealing is wrong yet you do it anyways, you contradict yourself – then that's not ok.

## Formulation 2: The formula of Humanity: How you should treat other people
Treat others as an end in and of themselves.

# Kant on freedom
He didn't espouse a libertarian kind of freedom where we lived unbounded by any law or governance. Rather he believed that freedom should be constrained by our potential nature in order to help promote the reasonableness of others so that we would all live to the highest moral standard.
