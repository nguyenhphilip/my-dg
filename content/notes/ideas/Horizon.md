# quotes
> "It was important to Walsh that a human being, not a rover or a probe, first saw the bottom of the Pacific. "You can't surprise a machine," he said to me. And it is this capacity to appreciate the unknown, to be surprised by it, he believes, that will always set the human explorer apart from the machine. The moment of surprise informs you emphatically that the way you once imagined the world is not the way it is. "To explore," he says, "is to travel without a hypothesis." [71]

> Cook, I think, did not entirely trust the assumptions behind the Enlightenment principles that urged him to measure, to record, and to define the world. He did not completely concede the authority that lay behind gradations of social rank, perhaps even naval rank. He spent his life charting raw space, putting down grids and elevations, but he also understood what could not be charted, the importance of the line that separated the known from the unknown. He understood what occured in the silence between two musical notes. He also knew, I blieve, the indispensability of this."
