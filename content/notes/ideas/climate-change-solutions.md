# measuring impact
greenhouse gases are measured in units of ==tons== or parts per million (PPM), which is the fraction of the emitted gas as part of the whole atmosphere.

Average American ==19 tons== of GHG emissions per year. (breakdown?)

It takes about 15 Gigatons of CO2 to raise the atmospheric concentration by 1ppm. We raise it about 2.5 ppm per year. (~35 gigatons of CO2 produced annually)

Megaton = 1 million t¸ZZvbons. Gigaton = 1 billion tons.

# Can We Make Progress in Reducing Emissions?
There is [evidence](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions) that $\text{CO}_2$ production is positively correlated with countries that have high standard of living and are rich. The reverse is also true: low emission countries tend to have lower standards of living and are poor. Is it possible to reduce emissions while retaining high standards of living?

Yes:

> A number of countries – such as the USA, UK, France, Spain, Italy, and many others – have managed to reduce emissions (even when we correct for trade) whilst increasing GDP.

## The more important question: Can we make progress fast enough? And how?

We need to focus on **energy** (electricity, heat, transport, industrial activity) and **food and agriculture**. Namely we need to make these systems more efficient ([using less energy to produce a given output; and using less land, fertilizer and other inputs for food production, and reducing food waste](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions)) and we need to transition to low-carbon alternatives (in energy this means shifting to renewables and nuclear; for food this means substituting carbon-intensive products for lower emitting ones.)

To summarize: How can we decarbonize our energy systems?

### Energy

1.  **Shift towards low-carbon electricity (reduce carbon intensity – carbon per unit energy)**  
    – Renewables  
    – Nuclear energy  
    – Shift from coal to gas (which emits less CO2 per unit energy) as an interim step  
    → **[Explore our work](https://ourworldindata.org/energy)** on energy.  
    → **[Explore our data](https://ourworldindata.org/emissions-by-fuel)** on CO2 emissions by fuel type  
    
2.  **Shift sectors such as transport, towards electricity.** Some energy sectors are harder to decarbonize – for example, transport. We therefore need to shift these forms towards electricity where we have viable low-carbon technologies.  
    → **[Explore our data](https://ourworldindata.org/emissions-by-sector)** on greenhouse gas emissions by sector.  
    
3.  **Develop low-cost low-carbon energy and battery technologies.** To do this quickly, and allow lower-income countries to avoid high-carbon development pathways, low-carbon energy needs to be cost-effective and the default choice.  
    
4.  **Improve energy efficiency – energy per unit GDP.**  
    → **[Explore our data](https://ourworldindata.org/meat-production)** on energy intensity.

### Food production and agriculture?

1.  **Reduce meat and dairy consumption, especially in higher-income countries.** Food production is responsible for [one-quarter of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions.](https://ourworldindata.org/food-ghg-emissions) Shift dietary patterns towards lower-carbon food products. This includes eating less meat and dairy generally, but also substituting high-impact meats (e.g. beef and lamb) for chicken, fish, or eggs. Innovation in meat substitutes could also play a large role here.  
    → **[Read our article](https://ourworldindata.org/food-choice-vs-eating-local)** on the carbon footprint of meat and dairy versus alternative foods.  
    → **[Explore our work](https://ourworldindata.org/meat-production)** on meat and dairy production.  
    -> On eating local? 
	1. ‘Eating local’ is a recommendation you hear often – even from prominent sources, [including the United Nations](https://twitter.com/UN/status/1188622911080415235?s=20). While it might make sense intuitively – after all, transport does lead to emissions – it is one of the most misguided pieces of advice. Eating locally would only have a significant impact if transport was responsible for a large share of food’s final carbon footprint. For most foods, this is _not_ the case. GHG emissions from transportation make up a very small amount of the emissions from food and what you eat is _far more_ important than where your food traveled from. 
	2. All processes in the supply after the food has left the farm mostly accounts for a small share of food and agriculture based emissions.
2.  **Promote lower-carbon meat and dairy production.** We are not going to cut out meat and dairy production completely any time soon (and doing so is unnecessary – large reductions would be sufficient). This makes the promotion of lower-carbon production methods essential.  
    → **[Read our article](https://ourworldindata.org/less-meat-or-sustainable-meat)** on the large differences in carbon footprint for specific meat and dairy products.  
    
3.  **Improve crop yields.** Sustainable intensification of agriculture allows us to grow more food on less land. This could help to prevent deforestation from agricultural expansion, and frees up land for replanting, or giving back to natural ecosystems.  
    → **[Explore our work](https://ourworldindata.org/crop-yields)** on Crop Yields.  
    
4.  **Reduce food waste.** Around one-third of food emissions come from food that is lost in supply chains or wasted by consumers. Improving harvesting techniques, refrigeration, transport and packaging in supply chains; and reducing consumer waste can reduce emissions significantly.

# Energy

Fossil fuels account for [80% of the world's energy production](https://ourworldindata.org/cheap-renewables-growth). Burning fossil fuels contributes to 87% of the world's $\text{CO}_2$ emissions. This is a problem for the climate, biodiversity, our species, and our health. We need cheaper alternatives for energy. 

> Not only is energy production the largest driver of climate change, the burning of fossil fuels and biomass also comes at a large cost to human health: at least ==five million== deaths are [attributed to air pollution](https://ourworldindata.org/air-pollution) each year.

Solar and wind powered electricity has gotten cheaper over the years thanks to learning curve effects - i.e. as installed capacity (amount of energy resources, e.g. number of wind turbines along the coast) increased exponentially, the price of solar and wind modules decreased exponentially - and are feasible alternatives. It's expected that their prices will continue to drop as well since we have yet to reach the limits of install capacity while demand increases.

## Electric Cars
### Life cycle global emissions: are EVs really better for the environment than gas-powered vehicles? 
Short answer yes. A two-year review of automobile emissions data found that when considering the lifecycle of a car – from manufacturing driving, and disposing of it – gasoline cars produce on average twice the amount of emissions than electric cars.

Manufacturing electric cars tends to produce more emissions than gasoline cars due to creation of the battery. But as soon as the cars hit the road, electric cars outdo gas cars in terms of emissions and, in many parts of the country, . With gasoline-fueled cars, pollution is produced for every gallon of gas burned, without accounting for the extra emissions generated from extracted, refining, and transporting gas to gas stations. Electric-powered cars use renewable electricity, which is a much cleaner alternative. Battery electric cars offset the extra manufacturing emissions within six to eighteen months, depending on the vehicle. 

For **everyone** in the country, charging the average new EV produces far fewer global warming pollutants than driving the average new gasoline car. In some of the country’s cleanest regions (including parts of California, New York, and the Pacific Northwest), driving an electric car is equivalent to getting 85 miles per gallon.

The process of generating renewable electricity is becoming more . One estimate notes that 2/3 of Americans live in regions where charging an electric car produces fewer global emissions than driving a 50mpg gasoline car. 

By the end of their lives you can expect the average gasoline car to produce 57 metric tons of emissions, vs 28 for an electric car. 



# Urban Design

In 2019, about **82.46 percent** of the total population in the United States lived in cities and urban areas. ([2019](https://www.statista.com/statistics/269967/urbanization-in-the-united-states/#:~:text=In%202019%2C%20about%2082.46%20percent,in%20cities%20and%20urban%20areas.))

	- The [research](https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41560-017-0032-9), published in Nature Energy, measures the **full lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions** of a range of sources of electricity **out to 2050**. It shows that ==the carbon footprint of solar, wind and nuclear power are many times lower than coal or gas with carbon capture and storage== (CCS). This remains true after accounting for emissions during manufacture, construction and fuel supply.
