title: structural brain correlates of adolescent resilience
---

## [resilience](notes/mental-health/resilience.md): high competence despite history of high adversity

The aim of the current study was to test for brain regions (structural) uniquely associated with positive functioning in the context of adversity, using detailed phenotypic classification.

## model: brain structure ~ resilience

Thus, the primary goal of the present project was to determine whether structural brain differences would be observed when adolescents who have experienced adversity yet are doing well in life were compared with both youth not at risk and youth not doing well, utilizing a large-scale sample with a range of experienced adversity and competence.
	
They predicted differences in prefrontal cortex volume based on prior studies as well as differences in cognitive control and planning.

## methods

Data are from the IMAGEN study, which represents eight sites across Europe: London, Nottingham, Dublin, Mannheim, Berlin, Hamburg, Paris, and Dresden.

## Adolescent participants
N = 1870
51.5% female
Mean age = 14.56 years
SD age = 0.44 years
range = 12.93-16.55 years
10.8% left-handed

## measures

- **Life-Events Questionnaire** (LEQ): main measure of adversity
- **Development and Well-being Assessment Interview**
- **Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ):** consists of five subscales 
	- emotional symptoms
	- conduct problems
	- hyperactivity/inattention
	- peer relationship problems
	- prosocial behaviors
- **European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Drugs**
- **Covariates**:
	- age
	- sex
	- pubertal development
	- verbal and performance IQ
	- study site
	- handedness
	- total gray matter volume
	- SES
**Imaging**
	- Structural MRI images (gray matter)

## Constructing competence and adversity

#### Adversity scores were constructed via the Life-Events Questionnaire
- the researchers selected only events that had a negative impact on a participant.
- a total count of independent negative life events
- excluded events that were not independent of participant's own competence behavior (e.g. running from home, trouble with the law, receiving poor grades)

#### Competence: continuous scores computed by averaging standardized scores across four domains (z-scoring). 
- ==rule abiding behavior==
	- combination of 15 dichotimized DAWBA items assessing rule-breaking behavior in the last year as well as 5 self and 5 parent report (0-2 scale) SDQ items. 
	- Once aggregated, the variables were reverse-scored such that higher scores represented more rule-abiding conduct
- ==social skills and relationships==
	- combination of 10 self and 11 parent report DAWBA items representing prosocial behavior (each scored 0-2 scale: 'generous', 'outgoing/sociable', 'caring', 'good with friends'...) as well as 10 self and 10 parent report SDQ items representing Peer Problems (reverse scored) and Prosocial Subscales
- ==academics==
	- two parent-reported DAWBA items (0-2 scale; good at school work,  general reasoning and school work)
	- one self-reported DAWBA item (0-2; good at school work)
	- one EPSAD (8-point scale representing A to C-)
- ==absense of internalizing problems (anxiety and depression)== (emotional health)
	- reverse of 5 self and parent reported SDQ emotional smptom items
		
**In each domain, scores were aggregated and standardized within measure, trunctating extreme scores +- 3 SD from the mean**

agreement between parent and self report on each measure was moderate, with all p-values < 0.001

## competence/adversity groupings: how did they create these groupings?

four groups based on high/low competence, and high/low adversity

|               |      | **Competence** |             |
| ------------- | ---- | -------------- | ----------- |
|               |      | high           | low         |
| **adversity** | high | Resilient      | Maladaptive |
|               | low  | competent      | Vulnerable  |

#### high/low competence
must be at minimum of -0.5 z-score on all four competence domains (rule abiding behavior, social skills and relationships, academics, absense of internalizing problems) -- strict definition of high competence

#### high/low adversity
6+ negative life events (+1 standard deviation) => high adversity, less than 6 = low
