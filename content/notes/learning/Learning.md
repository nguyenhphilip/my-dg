# The Myth of Learning Styles

> Learning “style” is task and domain specific, not learner specific. Variation in learning is better explained by interest and aptitude rather than leaning modality preference.
> – Nicole Barbaro

In order to study the effect of learning styles on learning, one needs an outcome measure. One obvious solution is to administer a test. Now we can setup an experiment (A randomized control trial). 

First one would gather people of different preferred learning styles. Then randomly assign your sample to different educational presentations, say (e.g. visual and auditory). So a chunk of the people in one condition have their preferred presentation, while the other chunk doesn't, across all conditions. After the session you administer the same test across all groups and assess performance. Those with their preferred learning presentation should perform better than those without. Yet that's not what has been found. Researchers don't see any differences at all.

Better predictors of learning outcome are probably things like intelligence, interest, and conscientiousness, rather than preferred learning modality.
