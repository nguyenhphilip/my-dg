# Sex Statistics

How often do couples have sex?

I imagine that the frequency depending on many things:

- individual levels of hornyness
- length of the relationship
- quality of the relationship
- opinions about sex and what sex is
   - e.g. does oral sex count as sex?
   - Or does it have to involve intercourse to be counted?
   - What about things like gay sex vs. straight sex?
      - via C: “When two lesbians have sex, it's sex, but if a straight couple were to do the same thing, it's not always considered sex?!”
- cultural attitudes
   - what’s deemed ok and not ok
- health (mental and physical) status
   - correlated with age
      - From Declines in Sexual Frequency among American Adults, 1989-2014:

      > American adults had sex about nine fewer times per year in the early 2010s compared to the late 1990s in data from the nationally representative General Social Survey, *N* = 26,620, 1989–2014. This was partially due to the higher percentage of unpartnered individuals, who have sex less frequently on average. Sexual frequency declined among the partnered (married or living together) but stayed steady among the unpartnered, reducing the marital/partnered advantage for sexual frequency.

      > Declines in sexual frequency were similar across gender, race, region, educational level, and work status and were largest among those in their 50s, those with school-age children, and those who did not watch pornography. In analyses separating the effects of age, time period, and cohort, the decline was primarily due to birth cohort (year of birth, also known as generation). With age and time period controlled, those born in the 1930s (Silent generation) had sex the most often, whereas those born in the 1990s (Millennials and iGen) had sex the least often. The decline was not linked to longer working hours or increased pornography use. Age had a strong effect on sexual frequency: Americans in their 20s had sex an average of about 80 times per year, compared to about 20 times per year for those in their 60s. The results suggest that Americans are having sex less frequently due to two primary factors: An increasing number of individuals without a steady or marital partner and a decline in sexual frequency among those with partners.

      Frequency doesn’t necessarily make you a happier couple (More sex is not necessarily better.) Having sex is more likely to be the result of couples that are already happy (which depends on happy individuals! [See: [how to be happy](notes/psychology/How-to-be-happy.md)]). Being happy is good. And do what works for you and your partner (e.g. each other heh).

Other random questions:
- How have attitudes surrounding sex changed over the years in America?
- Hook-up culture: is being sexually liberal always a good thing? Is there value in restraint?
- Differences in culture? (thinking of Aziz Ansari’s book *Modern Romance*)
