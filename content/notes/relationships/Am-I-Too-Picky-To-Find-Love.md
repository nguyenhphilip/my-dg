title: Am I Too Picky To Find Love

A great Ask Polly piece. Worth thinking about in the context of [notes/relationships/relationships](notes/relationships/relationships.md).

**Dear Polly,**

**Brace yourself for one of the most conceited querents you’ll ever encounter. At the blossoming age of 26, I’m here writing to you about the quest of trying to ‘have it all’ romantically. Growing up I was a major tomboy, a fashion anarchist, and a borderline spinster-in-training. I didn’t (and still won’t!) wear make-up, I didn’t care about popular fashion trends, I was incredibly nerdy, and although I had the odd crush here or there, I really wasn’t concerned with finding love, or a boyfriend. I devoted nearly all of my teen years to mixed martial arts training & sport events, gym workouts, and on the off-chance I had a moment to spare violent video-games.**

**During my college years I underwent a complete metamorphosis of personality, as one often does in undergrad; I found myself more open to expressing my femininity, and I emerged from an aloof geeky gym-rat to a boy-crazy stylish fem-bot. I haven’t killed the more “masculine” side to me, and I don’t think I ever will, but to see me now skipping down a street in my mini-skirt and pumps, I think it catches a lot of people off-guard when I reveal that my true self is far less glamorous (although the factle fait that I refuse to wear make-up beyond lip-gloss & eyebrow gel is probably a hint?). The problem I’m encountering here is that I want a partner who matches my aesthetics** _**and**_ **interests, and I’m starting to wonder if the challenge I’m issuing is just too much for the world of men to meet?** 

**What usually happens when I meet someone I’m attracted to is that I see beneath the surface they have no depth. I find nothing I can connect to, because they don’t enjoy me being myself. They are at best unaffected, and at worst repulsed by the side to me that won’t kowtow to all the sterile trappings of conventional femininity. They find my intellectualism boring. Ultimately, they treat me disrespectfully. An ex-friend of mine told me the answer to this was to lower my standards. I f followed his advice, and you know what, Polly? THAT SHIT IS FOR THE BIRDS. My low-standards matches might sometimes be on the same wave-length intellectually, but they put me on a pedestal, they don’t share my aesthetic sensibilities, and my romantic revulsion is instinctual, immediate & unbearable to overcome.**

**Dating with lowered standards was a painful experience that I was relieved to get out of. I’m a beautiful, interesting, caring, and intelligent woman. I deserve to receive everything I have to give. If I lower myself to date someone that I’m not attracted to, simply because they are attracted to me, I’m not helping anyone - least of all myself, and I don’t care how self-absorbed this sounds, it’s the truth (isn’t it?).** 

**I’m writing to you now, as a gal who has both seen what it’s like to go for what you want and fail, and also settled for something she felt beneath her, and I’m kind of at a loss for what to do. I’ve taken a break from dating to get off the yo-yo of my heart’s desire vs settlement, and I’m wondering if I should just throw this baby out with the bath water? I know this letter might have conveyed that I think too highly of myself, but I also can see my faults. I’m not perfect, even if I strive for it, but I’m at a point where I don’t think I’m over-estimating my worth, and I don’t want to exist in a relationship that forces me to believe otherwise. Could you please give me some perspective to take when I’m ready to get back on the battlefield of love; should I even try?**

**With love, light, and every bit of might,** 

**Holding Out for A Hero**

Dear Holding Out for A Hero,

Yes. Fuck settling. If it feels like settling, it’s no good.

Here’s the only disclaimer there: Sometimes love can feel a little bit like settling when the person in question is very very interested. If you find genuine interest unattractive, that’s not going to work out so well for you.

But that doesn’t mean you have to settle!

When I met my husband, I knew he was a catch. He was extremely smart, charming, funny, and exceptionally hot. But his bad style choices and nerdy facial tics, when combined with his complete and utter devotion to me, sometimes made me FEEL as if I was settling. Mind you, we had fun every time we hung out together. The sex was beyond great (and honestly it still is) (sex is important, don’t let anyone tell you otherwise).

But my husband wore pleated khakis when I met him. Pleated. Khakis. He had bad sideburns. I am no style maven myself, but it was criminal to see a hot man dressed so badly, with such a bad haircut and such ugly glasses. I mean, I didn’t even know how to fix the problem, I just knew that the visuals were all wrong.

He also had this weird twitchy thing that he did with his mouth whenever he felt insecure. As a self-hating human at the time, this would not fucking do. These days, I like insecure twitches. I like nerdiness in general way more than I did then. **But back then, I hadn’t sorted through my own shit thoroughly enough to know myself and love myself**. I had a hundred billion major insecurities buried very deep like hazardous waste. When I got angry, the waste would burble up to the surface, a toxic spring. Lamentable!

Oh, I was bad. I could not accept myself at all. **I’m still inconsistent and moody and sometimes I’m lazy and avoidant and sometimes I’m vainglorious and terrible, but I really do feel solid about who I am, and I like myself**. I’m not really hiding my flaws. They show.

So now other people’s flaws don’t frighten me as much. I don’t find flaws or bad style choices unattractive. They don’t seem gross or weird or ill-considered, even. I like freaks, so I like people who wear signs of their freakishness on the outside. I mean, unless what makes them freakish is how straight and formal and weirdly professional they are. That can be delightful, too, actually!

I guess I’m trying to say that I really like people for who they are now, or I just don’t. It’s not like I like everyone! **But I feel comfortable waiting and observing and seeing what’s there because I feel worthy of that extra time to observe. I’m allowed to like anyone or dislike anyone once I’ve given them room to show themselves.** I’m allowed to trust my feelings, even when it’s a perfectly annoying or perfectly amazing person in other people’s eyes. **I get to follow my gut.**

**Sometimes people like me, who are confident and mature (not in all areas, mind you! Just when it comes to issues of identity and personality!), don’t give very good advice to people like you, who are confident but not quite as experienced.** We say things like “Ignore his weird insecure tics! He’s such a _nice_ guy!” We seem to imply that you’re being shallow for liking what you like. And if we really love you a lot, then we want you to find someone who adores you, even if he looks like an incorrectly assembled jumble of nightmares to you and you just can’t do it. Since _we’ve_ found love and kept it and it’s helped us to calm the fuck down and feel good about so many different dimensions of our lives that we used to struggle with, we want you to have that same exact thing.

**We also remember what dicks we were, when we met our spouses. We remember having cold feet and worrying about whether or not we’d end up bored or annoyed or enraged. We were afraid of the million and one people we might become in the company of Mr. or Mrs. Wrong!**

**People who feel good and stable often look back and treat their former selves as confused, that’s all.** So we want to beam you forward into our shoes and say “See? What matters the most is shared values and loyalty and kindness, not looks or style or a tendency to repeat the same stupid stories over and over.”

**Even though we’re experienced and mature, we’re very immature, often, about respecting the fact that what other people want and need and crave might be utterly different from what _we_ want and need and crave.** For example: I cared about hotness when I was younger. That was pretty shallow. But choosing a hot man was very good for me! It carried me through the first five years of my marriage, when I was extremely insecure and temperamental and full of self-loathing. I never reached escape velocity, because I’d always go back to: YOU’RE HONESTLY GOING TO DUMP THE HOT PROFESSOR WHO ADORES YOU? _THAT’S_ YOUR CHOICE? _THAT’S_ THE TYPE OF CONFUSED GARBAGE YOU ARE?

I have a friend, on the other hand, who just looooves a guy with great aesthetic taste. It’s very hard for her to look down on a man with cool furniture, healthy plants, and interesting art on his walls. Even if he’s wrong in other ways, she can’t look away. This type of quality is her cat nip, the way mine is a very pretty face.

**We’re all allowed to recognize our own personal form of cat nip when we encounter it! It’s helpful and reassuring to know who you are and what you like!**

**What you have to watch out for is confusing your own insecurities with someone else’s, which will cause you to treat regular human traits like they’re dealbreakers. In other words, you have to be careful to find the _source_ of your discomfort or revulsion sometimes.** You have to notice when what you don’t like is not the man’s pants but the overall cluelessness that burbles out of the ground around him. And once you accept your own bumbling and clueless traits, you’ll be more likely to accept his.

**But you have to notice if you encounter adoration as a form of weakness.** When someone is extremely into you, and it makes you uncomfortable, and you start attributing your discomfort to that person’s bad shoes? That’s less than ideal. You can still care about his shoes. You can buy him _different_ shoes. **But you have to recognize that the feeling of BEING LOVED COMPLETELY is so unfamiliar to you that it’s almost repulsive.**

Likewise, when someone is extremely disinterested, and that makes you interested, and you don’t care how they dress or what they look like? That’s also less than ideal. **You can still enjoy the feeling of WORKING VERY HARD TO WIN SOMEONE OVER. You can still savor your attraction. But you have to realize that the feeling of BEING IGNORED COMPLETELY is so familiar to you that it’s pretty seductive.**

You have to know what’s acting on you. You have to know what your version of catnip is, yes, but you also have to know WHY that’s your version of catnip. You can take it at face value – I JUST LIKE THIS, WHATEVER! – but you also have to recognize that the universe likes to fuck with us. **The universe is a nasty little trickster, and it will put all kinds of confusing and weird combinations of humans in your face, and you’ll go chasing after what looks like your cat nip and you’ll discover there’s no real cat nip there. Or you’ll ignore someone who seems gross, only to discover that their weird little charms grow on you over time.**

**And when you find someone who truly makes sense, it’s not over, believe me.** **A finnicky motherfucker sometimes stays finnicky for far too long! That’s all the more reason why a finnicky motherfucker needs to know herself very very well.** **She needs to understand her flaws and insecurities. She needs to befriend her deepest worries and fears and mental blocks. She needs to welcome her anxieties into the room, and ask them polite questions until they let down their guard.**

**A finnicky human needs to watch and wait. She needs to know her body. She needs to monitor her desires. She needs to resist easy little stories that wrap up neatly.** She needs to step back from both hot stoves and reductive morals. She needs to calm the fuck down and enjoy this world and its dumb, tasteless, broken **people exactly as they are.** She doesn’t have to sleep with any of them, necessarily. But she does need to slow down and open her heart and open her eyes as much as possible.

That’s true when you’re dating and it’s also true when you’re married. It’s true with intimate partners and it’s also true with family and friends. You can think “I don’t like this apartment, I don’t like what his face is doing, I don’t like how his socks smell!” and **you have to keep in mind, that’s just your hyper-attuned, sensitive, sensual, perfectionist self doing its hyper-aware thing.** You can’t be happy if you’re constantly muting that part of you. You can’t beat that part of you back. **But you do have to fully accept that sometimes the noise in your head isn’t completely trustworthy.**

Sometimes you’re with a friend and they’re annoying and you’re also grateful to know them, _so_ fucking grateful. Sometimes you’re with a man with bad hair (I am right now, Jesus, you should see my husband’s hair) and you still want to hug and kiss on him because you trust him down to your toenails and he’s delicious. Sometimes you’re stressed and anxious about how everyone in your extended family is going to get along without a major blow-up on vacation, and even though you’re tempted to tell yourself a story about how fucked up and dysfunctional you all are, you also feel so full of love for those lunatics, and you’re so glad that everyone will be together.

**You need to ground yourself often, when you’re a finnicky little fuck. You need to reacquaint yourself with your deepest feelings and your most treasured principles and values. You need to tune into your body a lot. You need to let yourself be imperfect, first and last. You need to let go of your vision of how the future should look, and live in the moment instead.**

Because the universe loves nothing more than fucking with your vision of the future. THAT’S THE UNIVERSE’S CAT NIP. I mean, Christ, my cat nip used to be NEVER REFERRING TO “THE UNIVERSE” IN ANY CONTEXT WHATSOEVER, AND _NOW_ LOOK AT ME!

**So surrender. Surrender to the moment, surrender to reality, surrender to love.** Let that trickster universe show you what’s really here. Let it fuck you up. **Don’t fight it off with your special rules of what works and what doesn’t. Let it surprise you.**

**Let _you_ surprise you. As you well know, you are a liquid, ever-evolving entity, a complex system filled with mini-systems, a layered and dynamic microbiome, a proud human lava lamp. Your pride is not conceited. Your knowledge of yourself is not a liability. Your intuition is not your enemy. Welcome your shifty, molten core. Welcome your pickiness. Welcome your changing moods. Welcome it all, and welcome surprises. Let love fuck you up.**

**Don’t make predictions. Don’t make rules. Stay open and see what comes rushing your way. Prepare to get knocked down. Prepare to question everything. When you’re surprised by how you feel, that means you’re welcoming who you are, welcoming the world, welcoming imperfect reality. Welcome all of it.**
