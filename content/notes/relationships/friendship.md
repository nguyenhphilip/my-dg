# David Whyte, on friendship

> Frindship is a mirror to presence and a testament to forgiveness.  Friendship not only helps us see ourselves through another’s eyes, but can be sustained over the years only with someone who has repeatedly forgiven us for our trespasses as we must find it in ourselves to forgive them in turn.  A friend knows our difficulties and shadows and remains in sight, a companion to our vulnerabilities more than our triumphs, when we are under the strange illusion we do not need them.  An undercurrent of real friendship is a blessing exactly because its elemental form is rediscovered again and again through understanding and mercy.  All friendships of any length are based on a continued, mutual forgiveness.  Without tolerance and mercy all friendships die.
> 
> In the course of the years a close friendship will always reveal the shadow in the other as much as ourselves, to remain friends we must know the other and their difficulties and even their sins and encourage the best in them, not through critique but through addressing the better part of them, the leading creative edge of their incarnation, thus subtly discouraging what makes them smaller, less generous, less of themselves.
> 
> Through the eyes of a real friendship an individual is larger than their everyday actions, and through the eyes of another we receive a greater sense of our own personhood, one we can aspire to, the one in whom they have most faith.  Friendship is a moving frontier of understanding not only of the self and the other but also, of a possible and as yet unlived, future.
> 
> Friendship is the great hidden transmuter of all relationship: it can transform a troubled marriage, make honorable a professional rivalry, make sense of heartbreak and unrequited love and become the newly discovered ground for a mature parent-child relationship.
> 
> The dynamic of friendship is almost always underestimated as a constant force in human life: a diminishing circle of friends is the first terrible diagnostic of a life in deep trouble: of overwork, of too much emphasis on a professional identity, of forgetting who will be there when our armored personalities run into the inevitable natural disasters and vulnerabilities found in even the most average existence.
> 
> Through the eyes of a friend we especially learn to remain at least a little interesting to others.  When we flatten our personalities and lose our curiosity in the life of the world or of another, friendship loses spirit and animation; boredom is the second great killer of friendship.  Through the natural surprises of a relationship held through the passage of years we recognize the greater surprising circles of which we are a part and the faithfulness that leads to a wider sense of revelation independent of _human_ relationship: to learn to be friends with the Earth and sky, with the horizon and with the seasons, even with the disappearances of winter and in that faithfulness, take the difficult path of becoming a good friend to our own going.
> 
> Friendship transcends disappearance: an enduring friendship goes on after death, the exchange only transmuted by absence, the relationship advancing and maturing in a silent internal conversational way even after one half of the bond has passed on.
> 
> But no matter the medicinal virtues of being a true friend of sustaining a long close relationship with another, the ultimate touchstone of friendship is not improvement, neither of the other nor of the self, the ultimate touchstone is witness, the privilege of having been _seen_ by someone and the equal privilege of being granted the sight of the essence of another, to have walked with them and to have believed in them, and sometimes just to have accompanied them for however brief a span, on a journey impossible to accomplish alone.

# On making friends
> My "trick" is to do the same things at the same time. Be the guy who sits at the corner of the bar and always drinks a rum and coke at the same bar most Friday nights. Be the guy who sits at the library on Saturday mornings reading non-fiction books about Europe. Be the guy who orders a caramel macchiato at the local cafe every Sunday morning. Be the dude doing squats at the gym every Sunday evening. This is stuff I do, but whatever your pleasure, you get the idea.
> 
> Do this regularly, and you'll start seeing the same patrons/employees over and over, and eventually they'll start to recognize you and be comfortable with your presence.
>  
>  I made friends with a dude at the bar who also seemed to be there every Friday night, and saying was as simple as "hey, you're here again too? Mind if I sit with you?" and we hit it off.
>  
>  One of the librarians saw me coming in and said hi, and mentioned the library had a book club and since she saw me reading a lot, she mentioned they were looking for new members. (I didn't join because I don't have the time, but that would've been like 5+ potential new friends there).
>  
>  All too often, people give advice about "getting out of your comfort zone" or "try something new!" In my experience, you don't need to re-invent yourself as a person, you just need to create a routine that shows strangers what your interests are and invites them to join.
