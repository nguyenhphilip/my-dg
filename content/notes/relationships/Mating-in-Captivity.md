# Chapter 1: Why The Quest for Security Saps Erotic Vitality
- marriage and passion weren't always bound together
- it took the sexual revolution of the 60s, the breakthrough of birth control, and the advancement of women's rights before people were able to more freely choose their partners and consider these higher level desires
- the tradeoff of this gained freedom and independence is tangled with an increasing sense of [loneliness](notes/psychology/loneliness.md), which is then imposed upon our romantic [relationships](notes/relationships/relationships.md). Companionship and compassion are now coupled with the desire for the other to relieve our existential uncertainty.
- this need to alleviate uncertainty drives us toward security, which is what erodes eroticism. 
- Eroticism and desire are fueled by the distance of uncertainty, the excitement of not knowing, anticipating, imagining, separateness
- "...maybe the waning of romance is less about the bounds of familiarity and the weight of reality than it is about fear. Eroticism is risky. People are afraid of allowing themselves these moments of idealization and yearning for the person they live with. It introduces a recognition of the other's sovereignty that can feel destabilizing. **When our partner stands alone, with his own will and freedom, the delicateness of our bond is magnified**...when Adele looks at Alan out of the context of their marriage–switching from a zoom lens to a wide angle–his otherness is accentuated, and that in turn heightens Adele's attraction to him. She sees him as a man. She has transformed someone familiar into someone still unknown after all these years."
- Mystery is as much an inherent feature of all relationships as is uncertainty; the truth is we never fully know our partners. Rather we impose a story upon the relationship that makes it predictable, and we stick with it. 
- This leads to a loss of passion and desire, because we've discarded the uncertainty. Yet we can never be fully rid of it, nor have we truly gained security, all the while losing passion and eroticism in the process. There needs to be a fluidity, movement, room for growth and tolerance for change.
- It is our willingness to engage with the mystery that keeps the fire alive.
- "When we resist the urge to control, when we keep ourselves open, we preserve the possibility of discovery."
- Eroticism resides in the ambiguous space between anxiety and fascination

# Chapter 2: Love Seeks Closeness, but Desire Needs Distance
- "Love is at once an affirmation and a transcendence of who we are."
- "Beginnings are always ripe with possibilities, for they hold the promise of completion."
- "Sexuality is more than a metaphor for the relationship – it stands on its own as a parallel narrative."
- It is commonly assumed that sex and good sex follow from having deep intimacy, but that is not always the case. 
- Intimacy closes the distance, it is a merging of the individuals into a union. 
- But desire is fueled by distance and separateness. Separateness is the precondition that sustains connection. 
- This is why autonomy and independence are important, but alone not sufficient. It's about treading the line. Be a separate self, but not too distant. Tread the tension. 
- "You are such a caregiver that you can no longer be a lover."
- Inherent in the distance and separateness is desire's necessary selfishness.
- Don't foster the cozy kind of safety and security that deadens the relationship. Foster a dynamic one in which the individuals in a relationship can grow apart and come together.
- "But too often, as couples settle into the comfort of love, they cease to fan the flame of desire. They forget that fire needs air."
