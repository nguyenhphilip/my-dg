It's estimated that around 8 million people die prematurely from smoking.

It's not the smoking itself but the effect it has on your heart and lungs. 

The life expectancy of those who smoke regularly is around 10 years lower than that of non-smokers.

Historically smoking was one of those issues that no one believed was a problem until revealed by statistical analysis that it was. (The same thing happened regarding basic hand hygiene and maternal mortality following child birth. Doctors would perform autopsies and jump into delivering babies right after, without washing their hands. This lead to the death of many mothers right after they delivered their child.)
