How does caffeine delay sleep?::It delays the binding of adenosine. The adenosine [still builds up](https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/jul/06/caffeine-coffee-tea-invisible-addiction-is-it-time-to-give-up) though, and once the caffeine in our body has been fully metabolized, the adenosine receptors are suddenly flooded and we experience the "crash".
