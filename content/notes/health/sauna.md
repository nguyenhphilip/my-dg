### summary
- benefits (typically involving ~175F for ~20mins)
	- dose-dependent reduction in rates of heart-disease and premature mortality
	- less risk of developing [dementia](notes/health/dementia.md)
	- lower risk of psychosis (and possibly other [mental health](notes/mental-health/mental-health.md) issues)

### highlights 

Much of the findings of late interest seem to result from a large population-based cohort study (Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor (KIHD) Study) of health outcomes in 2300+ middle-aged men from Eastern Finland. I'm quoting here from [Found My Fitness](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/topics/sauna)[1] by Dr. Rhonda Patrick.

> "Men who used the sauna **4-7** times per week had a **66%** lower risk of developing  [dementia](notes/health/dementia.md) compared to men who used the sauna only one time per week."

These effects seem to be dose-dependent as well, meaning that higher doses led to improved effects.

> ...men who used the sauna two to three times per week were 27 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes than men who didn't use the sauna. Furthermore, the benefits they experienced were found to be dose-dependent: Men who used the sauna roughly _twice_ as often, about four to seven times per week, experienced roughly _twice_ the benefits – and were 50 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes. In addition, frequent sauna users were found to be 40 percent less likely to die from all causes of premature death. These findings held true even when considering age, activity levels, and lifestyle factors that might have influenced the men's health.

On mechanisms:

> Cardiac output, a measure of the amount of work the heart performs in response to the body's need for oxygen, increases by 60 to 70 percent, while the heart rate (the number of beats per minute) increases and the stroke volume (the amount of blood pumped) remains unchanged.[[5]](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/topics/sauna#bibid-7f954416abaa1ee08aaf017b714ed659) During this time, approximately 50 to 70 percent of the body's blood flow is redistributed from the core to the skin to facilitate sweating. The average person loses approximately 0.5 kg of sweat while sauna bathing.

Sounds like running, except without the running.

Sauna use may also train our bodies to respond better to stress, particularly "mild" stressors that may have a large 'magnitude' (e.g. we know the sauna itself isn't as stressful as say, being chased, but it is a powerful exogenous force on its own):

> Repeated sauna use acclimates the body to heat and optimizes the body's response to future exposures, likely due to a biological phenomenon known as hormesis, a compensatory defense response following exposure to a mild stressor that is disproportionate to the magnitude of the stressor. Hormesis triggers a vast array of protective mechanisms that not only repair cell damage but also provide protection from subsequent exposures to more devastating stressors.

Because of these effects, sauna use has been proposed as an alternative to exercise. Maybe that's why so many middle- to old-aged people benefit from it. It may be that you can confer the benefits of exercise using extreme temperature interventions (e.g. cold showers and saunas):

> The physiological responses to sauna use are remarkably similar to those experienced during moderate- to vigorous-intensity exercise. In fact, sauna use has been proposed as an alternative to exercise for people who are unable to engage in physical activity due to chronic disease or physical limitations.
> ...
> During sauna use or moderate exercise, the participants' heart rate and blood pressure increased immediately, but after the sauna or exercise session, participants' blood pressure and heart rate began to drop below baseline levels measured pre-sauna or -exercise. Like exercise, long-term sauna use generally improves blood pressure, endothelial function, and left ventricular function, and reduces inflammation.

The added benefit of sauna use, on top of the benefits already garnered in exercise, is governed by molecular mechanisms that protect your proteins and activate restorative processes:

> The hormetic effects of heat stress are facilitated by molecular mechanisms that **mitigate protein damage and aggregation** and **activate endogenous antioxidant, repair, and degradation processes**. Many of these responses are also triggered in response to moderate- to vigorous-intensity exercise and include increased **expression of heat shock proteins, transcriptional regulators,** and **pro-** and **anti-inflammatory factors.**


It also seems to increase [bdnf](notes/health/bdnf.md), a protein that promotes new neuron growth. 

> BDNF modulates neuronal plasticity and ameliorates anxiety and depression from early-life stressful events. It is active in the hippocampus, cortex, cerebellum, and basal forebrain – areas involved in learning, long term memory, and executive function. BDNF is also produced in exercising muscle tissue, where it plays a role in muscle repair and the growth of new muscle cells.

On the relationship between heart health and cognitive decline – blood flow is good:

> Normal cognitive function relies on **sufficient blood flow to the brain and peripheral nervous system, so cardiovascular diseases and cognitive decline often go hand-in-hand.** For example, hypertension alters the structure of cerebral blood vessels and impairs blood flow to the brain. Poor cerebral blood flow is commonly observed in mice and humans and may contribute to impaired amyloid-beta clearance, thereby accelerating the progression of Alzheimer's disease.

And on the relationship between sauna use and [depression](notes/mental-health/depression.md) – inflammation is bad:

> Elevated biomarkers of inflammation are commonly observed in people who have depression. Chronic activation of the body's inflammatory response system promotes the development of depressive symptoms and induces changes in brain and neuroendocrine function. Sauna use has been shown to reduce symptoms of depression.
