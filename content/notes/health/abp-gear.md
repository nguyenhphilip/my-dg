- >  Food and Water: For the most part, I’ll only be carrying one to two days’ worth of food and water at a time. During the eastern portion of my trip, I’ll be passing through small towns several times a day, where I’ll load up on food items like peanut butter, bagels, cured meats, avocados, granola, and nuts. Nothing I carry can be refrigerated, so any food that I pack must keep for a few days without going bad. As for water, I’ll be carrying two bike water bottles, and two Nalgenes. If you have travel food tips to share, leave your suggestions in a comment below!

- > For the majority of my journey I’ll be splitting my time between looking for hosts through organizations such as [CouchSurfing.com](https://www.couchsurfing.com/) and [WarmShowers.org](https://www.warmshowers.org/), and sleeping in public and private campgrounds near my route. I will be using a lightweight REI backpacking tent, which comfortably fits my inflatable [Therm-A-Rest NeoAir XLite sleeping pad](http://adventure.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/gear/gear-of-the-year-spring-summer-2016/#/goy-therma-rest-sleeping-pad_94603_600x450.jpg), Western Mountaineering Antelope 0 degree sleeping bag, and my bike panniers.
