It's known that grapefruit can delay the metabolism of certain drugs in the body and have other interaction effects, so much so that some drugs are required to have a label on them warning against their use with grapefruit. 

Grapefruit (==200mL== of grapefruit juice, or a whole grapefruit) blocks the action of an enzyme in the small intestine called CYP3A4, which is an enzyme that helps metabolize many drugs. This can be a problem because the drugs stay longer in your bloodstream; they aren't being broken down quickly enough.

The opposite effect can also happen: it prevents certain drugs from having their intended effect by inhibiting the related transporters.

Among them are things like [[notes/health/caffeine]]. Grapefruit extends and amplifies its effects.
