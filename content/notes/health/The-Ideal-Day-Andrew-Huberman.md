# Protocol 1: Record Your Daily Waking Time & Temperature Minimum
- Writing down when you wake up provides information about your temperature minimum
- Why is the temperature minimum important?
	- It's the time in each 24 hour cycle that your body temperature is lowest. Typically this is 2 hours before your wake up time. (E.G. Your lowest temperature is at 4am if you wake up at 6am, on average)
	- Knowing this helps you shift your circadian clock (useful for travel, eating schedule)

# Protocol 2: Self-Generate Forward Motion (Outdoors)
- "Nerd speak for taking a walk"; "Forward ambulation" and generating optic flow lowers activity in the [amygdala](notes/neuro/amygdala.md), which lowers levels of anxiety. It pushes your neurology into an alert and lower anxiety state.

# Protocol 3: View Natural Light For 10-30min Every Morning
- perhaps the most important thing we can do to promote our [physical health](notes/health/physical-health.md), [mental health](notes/mental-health/mental-health.md), [sleep](notes/health/sleep.md)
- getting sunlight sets in motion all the important processes of every cell in your body ([circadian rhythm](notes/health/circadian-rhythm.md))
- pulse of cortisol arrives dependent on when you view bright light (ideally via indirect sunlight); you want it early

# Protocol 4: Hydrate Correctly

# Protocol 5: Delay [caffeine](notes/health/caffeine.md) 90-120m After Waking

# Protocol 6: Fast (or Fat-Fast) Until Noon
- Why does fasting help with learning?::Fasting increases levels of adrenaline / epinephrine. Adrenaline causes us to learn and focus better. Though too much adrenaline leads to high levels of stress, which is detrimental to [Learning](notes/learning/Learning.md).

## What Actually Breaks A Fast & What Doesnâ€™t?
- It depends on a number of things. Your recent eating history, your current blood sugar levels, your glycogen stores. Generally you don't want to spike your insulin. So things high in fat like almonds are probably okay, assuming you're on a normal eating schedule. But if you've eaten something at 2am and want to eat something at 11am, you will likely break your fast because your blood sugar levels are probably still high.
 
# Protocol 7: Optimize Deep [work](notes/ideas/work.md): Visual Elevation, [Ultradian Cycles](notes/health/Ultradian-Cycles.md), White Noise

- When our eyes are directed upward (eye lids open) it creates a state of heightened alertness due to the relationship between the eyes and the brainstem. What this means is to position your devices, books, and screens at eye level, ideally higher. The converse is also true: looking down promotes sleepiness, calmness, and relaxation. 

- Ideal bouts of work: 90 minutes in lieu of [Ultradian Cycles](notes/health/Ultradian-Cycles.md). There is an initial hurdle to get over, but once you get into "the tunnel", it's easier to focus and do deep work.

- Low level white noise: background noise, not with headphones. Areas of the brain associated with attention and dopamine release are activated.

- After one 90 minute learning bout, ideally you then engage in NSDR and exercise.

- within learning bouts there's some evidence that brief 10 second pauses enhances the rate of information encoding


## Optimal Time of Day To Do Hard Mental [work](notes/ideas/work.md)

Think back to your temperature minimum (your wake-up time minus ~2 hours: for me around 4am). Huberman notes that we do our best work will be done anywhere from 4-6 hours after temperature minimum. So for me the optimal time to do deep work is anywhere between 8-11am. 

# Protocol 8: Optimal [exercise](notes/health/exercise.md); 3:2 Ratio

## Tools for Training & Mental Focus: Fasting, Salt, Stimulants, Alpha-GPC

# Protocol 9: Eat For Brain Function & Mood
- Sufficient levels of omega-3 fatty acids supports healthy mood and can act as a healthy antidepressant. (1000mg EPA omega-3s can be as powerful as prescription antidepressants. Can be used in conjunction with a lower dose medication to confer less side effects)

# Protocol 10: Get Your Testosterone & Estrogen In An Ideal Range

# Protocol 11: Reset the Mind & Body, Enhance neuroplasticity, (Reveri.com)

# Protocol 12: Hydrate Correctly, Nap Rules

# Protocol 13: View Late Afternoon/Evening Light To Support [sleep](notes/health/sleep.md) & Dopamine

# Protocol 14: Eat Dinner That Promotes Serotonin, Calm Sleep

# Protocol 15: Optimize Falling & Staying Asleep; Tools & Supplements That Work

# Protocol 16: Preventing Middle of the Night Waking

# Protocol 17: Weekends, Recovering From A Poor Nights [sleep](notes/health/sleep.md)
