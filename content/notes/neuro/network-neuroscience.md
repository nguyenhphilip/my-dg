# Abstract of famous Bassett paper
Despite substantial recent progress, our understanding of the principles and mechanisms underlying complex brain function and cognition remains incomplete. Network neuroscience proposes to tackle these enduring challenges. Approaching brain structure and function from an explicitly integrative perspective, ==network neuroscience pursues new ways to map, record, analyze and model the elements and interactions of neurobiological systems.== Two parallel trends drive the approach: the availability of new empirical tools to create comprehensive maps and record ==dynamic patterns among molecules, neurons, brain areas and social systems==; and the theoretical framework and computational tools of modern network science. The convergence of empirical and computational advances opens new frontiers of scientific inquiry, including network dynamics, manipulation and control of brain networks, and integration of network processes across spatiotemporal domains. We review emerging trends in network neuroscience and attempt to chart a path toward a better understanding of the brain as a multiscale networked system.
	
Network neuroscience is concerned with the inter-relations between various neurobiological systems e.g. gene network interactions with brain network activity. Can be thought of as a subfield of[network science](notes/statistics/network-science.md).

Network neuroscience encompasses the study of very different networks encountered across many spatial and temporal scales. Starting from the smallest elements, network neuroscience seeks to bridge information encoded in the relationships between genes and biomolecules to the information shared between neurons. It seeks to build a mechanistic understanding of how neuron-level processes give rise to the structure and function of large-scale circuits, brain systems and whole-brain structure and function. However, network neuroscience does not stop at the brain, but instead asks how these patterns of interconnectivity in the CNS drive and interact with patterns of behavior: how perception and action are mutually linked and how brain-environment interactions influence cognition. Finally, network neuroscience asks how all of these levels of inquiry help us to understand the interactions between social beings that give rise to ecologies, economies and cultures. Rather than reducing systems to a list of parts defined at a particular scale, network neuroscience embraces the complexity of the interactions between the parts and acknowledges the dependence of phenomena across scales. Box dimensions give outer bounds of the spatial and temporal scales at which relational data are measured and interactions unfold, and over which networks exhibit characteristic variations and dynamic changes.
