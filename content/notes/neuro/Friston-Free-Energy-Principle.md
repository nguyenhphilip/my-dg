title: Friston Free Energy Principle

[A Primer](https://jaredtumiel.github.io/blog/2020/08/08/free-energy1.html#fnref:1)

- data comes in, we perceive it
- not all of it is useful for survival, we only want to pay attention to the stuff that causes this data
	- tiger > mad? > bad
	- smell > cookies ? > food

micro random, macro stable - "attraction set" - we are a tightly-bounded pattern governed by dynamical systems

small subset of all possible ways to configure your atoms is You, your phenotype. homeostasis is the process of maintaining this equilibrium. "to survive long-term, you need to have a high probability of occupying states that are compatible with life"
