title: The Power of Ritual - Turning Everyday Activities Into Soulful Practices
tags: [meaning, habits, psychology]

Much of the ideas in this book remind me of [This Life](This-Life.md) by Martin Hägglund. What matters is this life. It is here that we relate and live and find meaning. The task is "[To see a World in a Grain of Sand\\And a Heaven in a Wild Flower](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43650/auguries-of-innocence)". Instead of finding salvation in some foreign abstract, we can build relationships with the people, nature, and world around us. This is our home.

What one person finds pleasant and mundane may be sacred and meaningful to another.

> That's what this book is all about - taking things we do every day and layering meaning and ritual onto them, even experiences as ordinary as reading or eating - by thinking of them as spiritual practices.

Religion no longer serves us in this rapidly shifting world. 

People are more attuned to finding meaning and connection in their daily lives now: in a yoga class or their job, while meditating or writing or hiking or reading, on a walk during sunset. 

By ritualizing these activities with **intention**, **attention**, and **repetition**, we raise them to a higher level of importance, to something truly special and sacred. 

*Slight aside on CrossFit*: One example of an organization whose members have embodied these ideas is CrossFit.

- > CrossFit is my church.
- It's not just a gym to them. It's a community. A cult founded on good values:
- > Cofounder Greg Glassman: "We kept being asked 'Are you a cult?' And after a while I realized, maybe we are. This is an active, sweating, loving, breathing community. I'ts not an insult toa CrossFitter to be called part of a cult. Discipline, honesty, courage, accountability – what you learn in the gym is also training for life. CrossFit makes better people."
- Glassman, at war with the lifestyle America promotes:
- > "Three hundred fifty thousand Americans are going to die next year from sitting on the couch. That's dangerous. The TV is dangerous. Squatting isn't."
- CrossFit is also civically involved:
- > Glassman is at war with America's soda industry. As diabetes rates continue to climb and Coca-Cola and PepsiCo fund public health research that minimizes the imapct of a high-calorie diet, Glassman sees Big Soda as the next frontier of corporate crime.
- > In Southern California, gym leaders invited a local politican to hold rallies in their communities, joining forces to take on the Big Soda lobby.Nationally, CrossFit is also affiliated with a network of nonprofit gyms supporting people in their recovery journey from addiction.

This phenomenon of secular meaning goes beyond fitness communities:

> Groups that gather people around play and the creative arts wer also spaces for building community. At Artisan's Asylum, a maker space in Somerville, Massachusetts, a community has formed of artists, artisans, tinkerers, jewelry makers, robot creators, captains of mutant bicycles that look like spaceships, engineers, designers, and more. The creative spirit that runs through the space is embodied in the generosity of members showing one another how to use unfamiliar machines or materials.

We can use the wisdom of ancient traditions to ground and make more sacred our modern community building and meaning-making efforts:

> What studying these modern communities taught me is this: we are building lives of meaning and connection outside of traditional religious spaces, but making it up as we go along can only take us so far. We need help to ground and enrich these practices. And if we are brave enough to look, it is in ancient traditions where we find incredibly insight and creativity that we can adapt for our modern world.

Why any of this matters is that we are social creatures. We find meaning in community, and isolation is a problem in the modern world.

> While our culture often lifts up the importance of self-care, we're desperately in need of community care. Without it, the impact of social isolation shows up in numerous ways. It is harder to find work. We fall out of healthy habits. And in heat waves or superstorms, we're more likely to be forgotten by neighbors and perish.

More and more people, even religious people, are adopting particular practices and ways of being that are more personalized and suitable for them, which is great, but leaves us quite fractured.

The goal is to build a sacred foundation for your life with what already exists through means of connection: 

- with yourself
- with the people around you
- with the natural world
- with the transcendent

Common to sacred practices and rituals are 3 elements:

- intention
- attention
- repetition

> Though you may take the dog out for a walk numerous times a day, ticking off the repetition component, it isn't a ritual practice if you're also on the phone because you're not really paying attention to your pup and the walk you're on. It's simply a habit. Or you might read every night before bedtime, but not really bring any specific intention to it. Again, that doesn't match our description of a ritual or practice.

Anything is fair game to become a spiritual practice. On [spirituality](private/personal/spirituality-summer-grass.md):

> A note on the world spiritual: it is easy to avoid the "spiritual" today. We try to satiate our longing for connection by scrolling endlessly through social media feeds. My personal favorite is the YouTube hole, where after an hour I look up from my phone and can't believe the time that's passed while I've been watching drag queens or soccer match recaps.
> 
> When we do pay attention to the moments of real meaning, they can overwhelm us. Holding a baby in our arms for the first time, hearing music that makes us weep, being out on the water and feeling completely at one with the elements around us - it can be overpowering to feel deeply connected. These moments unlock memories, longings, traumas, and frequently, tears. And to me, these moments are sacred. They are spiritual. But usually, we allow time to pass, and these moments drift away. The shimmering flashes of life's fullness get lost behind the stack of unanswered email and the relentless drudgery of the everyday. We forget the intention we'd set to go out into the forest more often, to start making music again, to spend more time with the ones we love. (At least I know I do).
> 
> Think about your own life. When was the last time you felt deeply connected to something bigger than yourself? Where were you? What did that feel like? And what words would you use to communicate that experience? By and large, we are starved of good language to describe what matters most to us, to confidently communicate with others those moments of deep meaning. And as spiritual teacher, scholar, and activist Barbara Holmes writes, our isolation in experiencing moments like these further privatizes our interpreation of them.
> 
> Stay with me if you can, even if these words feel a little uncomfortable. Imagine they're beautiful new leather shoes thate still a little rigid as you walk. They just need some time before they've modled to the shape of your feet. Soon enough you'll have found the right words, or become used to these, to help you pinpoint that feeling we're talking about together. 

Why it's hard to talk about spirituality, and the illusion that there is a boundary between the sacred and profane:

> This language challenge isn't random. It's tricky for a reason. We've been taught to see the world as divided between the sacred and the profane, the religious and the secular. **We've been taught that there's somehow a line that makes a church building sacred and a supermarket secular. That vertical line is an invention. Instead, imagine a horizontal line between the shallow and the deep. It stretches across every place and every person. When we can sink below the blur of the habit, we can be present to that portion of our experience where we find deepest meaning. Maybe it's [poetry](notes/Poems/Poems-directory.md) that takes us there. Or an incredible piece of theater. Or psychedelics. Or the arms of our beloved. Or simply watching our kids running through the yard. When we look at the world that way, any place and any time can be sacred. It all depends on how we look at it. Who is to say a tender interaction at the checkout counter can't feel sacred? And surely there are plenty of congregations that feel about as intimate as a subway station.**

Of course I'm thinking of [the comment here by Jan Sand](private/personal/weekly/2021-W34.md)
