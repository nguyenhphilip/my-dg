The odds of an event is the ratio of the probability that the event occurs over the probability that the event doesn't occur. e.g. $$odds(X)=\frac{P(X)}{1-P(X)}$$.

The odds ratio is a ratio of two odds. i.e. $$\frac{odds(X)}{odds(Y)}=\frac{\frac{P(X)}{1-P(X)}}{\frac{P(Y)}{1-P(Y)}}$$ If we have a loaded coin where $P(heads_{loaded})=0.7$ and a regular coin where $P(heads)=0.5$, then the odds of getting heads on the loaded coin are $$\frac{odds(heads_{loaded})}{odds(heads)}=\frac{\frac{0.7}{0.3}}{\frac{0.5}{0.5}}=2.333$$. 

So the odds of seeing heads on a loaded coin are 2.33 times higher than on a fair coin. This is comparison is relative. That's the meaning of a ratio.
