title: system of linear equations
---

Generally of the form $$Ax = b$$ where $A$ represents a matrix of coefficients, $x$ is a vector of unknowns, and $b$ is a vector of known values. We usually want to solve for $x$, meaning we want to find a unique vector (if possible) that satisfies the equation.

In systems of linear equations, trying to solve for $x$ results in:
- no solution
- a unique solution
- infinitely many solutions (redundancy)

Geometrically, the solution to a system of linear equations is the point, line, plane, or hyperplane where each equation intersects.

When there are more unknowns than equations, we generally expect ==infinitely many== solutions. I.E. When there are more unknowns than the rank of the column space (the rank of the column space is the number of independent basis vectors)
