title: survivorship bias
---

A form of selection bias where what we see is the end result of things that "survived" some process, where others did not, thus leading us to false conclusions about the phenomena

# examples
> thinking that an incident was not as dangerous as it was because everyone communicated with afterwards survived. Even if one knew that some people are dead, they would not have their voice to add to the conversation, leading to bias in the conversation.

positive deviants: i.e. being a rebellious worker, often rarer and more on display in organizations, but not necessarily causal of their innovations and success

# World War II and Abraham Wald

> During World War II, the statistician [Abraham Wald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Wald) took survivorship bias into his calculations when considering how to minimize bomber losses to enemy fire.[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias#cite_note-Wald1943-11) The Statistical Research Group (SRG) at [Columbia University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University "Columbia University"), which Wald was a part of, examined the damage done to aircraft that had returned from missions and recommended adding armor to the areas that showed the least damage, based on his reasoning. This contradicted the US military's conclusions that the _most-hit_ areas of the plane needed additional armor.[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias#cite_note-12)[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias#cite_note-13)[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias#cite_note-14) Wald noted that the military only considered the aircraft that had _survived_ their missions; any bombers that had been shot down or otherwise lost had logically also been rendered unavailable for assessment. The bullet holes in the returning aircraft, then, represented areas where a bomber could take damage and still fly well enough to return safely to base. Thus, Wald proposed that the Navy reinforce areas where the returning aircraft were unscathed,[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias#cite_note-Wald1943-11):88 since those were the areas that, if hit, would cause the plane to be lost. His work is considered seminal in the then-nascent discipline of [operational research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_research "Operational research").[\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias#cite_note-Mangel1984-15)
