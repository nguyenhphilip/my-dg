title: Logistic Regression
---

A statistical model that models the log-odds relationship between a binary dependent variable and the associated explanatory variables.

Unlike [linear regression](notes/statistics/linear-regression.md), the cost function of logistic regression cannot be optimized analytically (i.e. it has no closed form, mathematical solution), so we use [Gradient Descent](notes/statistics/Gradient-Descent.md)
