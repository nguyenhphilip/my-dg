title: statistical independence
---

Two events, A and B, are statistically independent when $$ P(A|B) = P(A) $$

Quick example: the probability of drawing an ace with and without replacement.

With replacement: the probability of drawing an ace on the second draw after drawing an ace on the first draw is independent (because we replace the card).

Without replacement: we don't replace the ace we draw the first time, so the probability of drawing another ace isn't independent

For independent events, the joint probability is the product of their marginal probabilities: $$P(A,B) = P(A)P(B)$$
