The proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (Y) predicted by the independent variable(s).

Formula: $$ 1 - \frac{SS_\text{residuals}}{SS_\text{total}}$$

where $${SS_\text{total}} = \sum_i({y_i - \bar{y}})^2$$ is the total sum of squares, and $${SS_\text{residuals}} = \sum_i(y_i - f_i)^2$$ where $f_i$ is the associated predicted value with index $i$.

Relevant when considering [effect size](notes/statistics/effect-size.md)
