title: The Haunted DAG and Causal Terror

# Chapter 6 of [Statistical Rethinking](notes/statistics/Statistical-Rethinking.md)

>This chapter and the next are both about terrible things that can happen when we simply add variables to a regression, without a clear idea of a causal model. In this chapter, we’ll explore three different hazards: [multicollinearity](notes/statistics/multicollinearity.md), [post-treatment bias](notes/statistics/post-treatment-bias.md), and [collider bias](notes/statistics/collider-bias.md). We’ll end by tying all of these examples together in a framework that can tell us which variables we must and must not add to a model in order to arrive at valid inferences. But this framework does not do the most important step for us: It will not give us a valid model.
