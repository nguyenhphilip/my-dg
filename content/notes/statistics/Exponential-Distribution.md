Probability density function: $$f(x,\lambda)={\lambda}e^{-\lambda{x}}$$ where $\lambda$ is the rate parameter.

Expectation: $$E[X] = \frac{1}{\lambda} $$ in words, if the rate of calls is 2 per hour, then you can expect to wait half an hour between every call. The expectation is the average displacement, or the inverse of the rate.

Variance: $$Var[X] = \frac{1}{\lambda^2} $$, so the standard deviation is equal to the mean.
