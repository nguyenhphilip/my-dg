# Expected Value
The long-run average value of a discrete random variable, say $X$, with support $c$ is $$E(X) = \sum_{c{\in}A}{c}{P(X=c)}$$.



# Properties of Expected Values
1)  $E(X+Y) = E(X) + E(Y)$
2) $E(aX) = aE(X)$
3) $E(g(X)) = \sum_{c{\in}A}{g(c)}{P(X=c)}$ where $A$ is the support of $X$
4) $E(UV) = EU{\cdot}EV$ if $U$ and $V$ are independent.
