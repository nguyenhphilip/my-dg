title: standard error
---

# definition
- an estimate of uncertainty regarding the population parameter under interest (e.g. weight, height of adults in US)
- formula: $$\sqrt{\frac{SD_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{SD_2^2}{n_2}}$$ where $SD_1^2$ and $SD_2^2$ are the variances of each group

# relevance
- we're uncertain about our parameters because we usually use a sample to estimate them. Standard error refers to the uncertainty surrounding the estimates of our parameters
- We can reduce the standard error by ==increasing our sample size== before calculating an estimate
- in other words, our standard error decreases as sample size increases
- Case in point: if we somehow the sample size reaches the population size, then we have 0 uncertainty about the parameter of interest
