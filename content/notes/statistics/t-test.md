title: t-test
---

Main question the t-test answers: What is the likelihood that we would find a [t-statistic](notes/statistics/t-statistic.md) of this size, if the true difference between groups is zero or less (i.e.Â the directional null hypothesis)?

In other words, if we assume that the ==[t-distribution](notes/statistics/t-distribution.md)== captures our null hypothesis, how likely is it that we then observe our [t-statistic](notes/statistics/t-statistic.md)? If it's unlikely then we can reject the null hypothesis. #flashcards
