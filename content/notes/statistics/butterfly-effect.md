title: butterfly effect
---

The sensitive dependence on initial conditions whereby a small change in a deterministic nonlinear system can result in large differences in a later state. 

Coined by mathematician Edward Lorenz. He used the example of a tornado's initial starting point and the path it follows, saying that where it goes can vary widely because of minor perturbations such as the flapping of a butterfly's wings weeks earlier. 

> The phrase refers to the idea that a butterfly's wings might create tiny changes in the [atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_atmosphere "Earth's atmosphere") that may ultimately alter the path of a [tornado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado "Tornado") or delay, accelerate or even prevent the occurrence of a tornado in another location. The butterfly does not power or directly create the tornado, but the term is intended to imply that the flap of the butterfly's wings can _cause_ the tornado: in the sense that the flap of the wings is a part of the initial conditions of an interconnected complex web; one set of conditions leads to a tornado, while the other set of conditions doesn't. The flapping wing represents a small change in the initial condition of the system, which cascades to large-scale alterations of events (compare: [domino effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domino_effect "Domino effect")). Had the butterfly not flapped its wings, the [trajectory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajectory "Trajectory") of the system might have been vastly differentâ€”but it's also equally possible that the set of conditions without the butterfly flapping its wings is the set that leads to a tornado.

Directly linked to chaos theory and the study of nonlinear dynamical systems.
