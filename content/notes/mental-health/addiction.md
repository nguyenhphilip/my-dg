> "I stumbled upon your YouTube channel a few days ago. I just wanted to say thank you and let you know that your videos are being shown to drug addicts at a facility in Dayton, OH where they are making a real impact on our patients. This area has been ravaged by heroine addiction and I work as a counselor helping people turn their lives around. Many of the clients I work with have never heard the things found in the content of these videos. The content paired with the illustrations makes them memorable and easier to understand. Your videos are spreading good in the world and making the world a better place. Thank you."

> "When I was young, everything was so clear. My purpose and my goals. I wanted to help people, to help animals, to help the world. But the world and life was cruel to me. I remember how hard it was to cope with the reality of how bad life can be. I detached from everything and everyone. I was so alone. It's as if the world crushed my spirit and I could only find refuge in myself; in my dreams and detached realities. The older I got the easier it was to bury that boy with the big heart and big dreams. The world got darker, and so did I. I've always struggled with addictions, thank you for this video. I've been trying to find that boy again for the past few months, as I knew something was missing, and I wasn't becoming the man I was meant to be. Now the dots seem more connected. Thank you again." - a comment from YTer
