# questions
- are there structural differences between high and low resilience kids?
- what about function?
- prior regions of interest: prefrontal cortex, amygdala, hippocampus
- connectivity differences?
	
# notes
- [contextual memory](notes/psychology/contextual-memory.md) are memories formed within a specific context. this is relevant to [PTSD](notes/mental-health/PTSD.md) because traumatic events are deeply encoded in the mind and body. The process of recontextualizing, healing, reconnecting with yourself involves in part extinguishing these memories
- Nick found a non-linear interaction via a genetic programming approach between adversity and ventromedial prefrontal cortex volume divided by hippocampus volume
	
# methods
- feed network features (structural, functional) to machine learning model
	
# measures
- outcome:
