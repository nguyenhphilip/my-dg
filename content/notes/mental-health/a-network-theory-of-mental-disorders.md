# Summary
An alternative conception of [mental health](notes/mental-health/mental-health.md) where the disorder arises from direct interactions between symptoms. It's a framework that causally connects symptoms of psychopathology to biological, psychological, and societal mechanisms. If the interplay of these mechanisms are strong enough, then a feedback loop is created that makes the symptoms self-sustaining, i.e. the network gets stuck in a disordered state. "The network theory holds that this is a general feature of [mental health](notes/mental-health/mental-health.md), which can therefore be understood as alternative stable states of strongly connected symptom networks."

# The need for a theory of psychopathology
The treatment of mental disorders has been largely ineffective and inconsistent. This is due, in part, to how we conceptualize mental disorders. Specifically we frame them as medical diseases, which implies that there is a singular common cause that gives rise to a set of symptoms (e.g. tumor in lungs > cough up blood, chest pain, short of breath). The problem with this approach for [mental health](notes/mental-health/mental-health.md) is that ==for all but a few constellation of symptoms that hang together empirically, often for unknown reasons, the common pathogenic pathways of [mental health](notes/mental-health/mental-health.md) have remained elusive.==

# The network approach to psychopathology

Some researchers posit that there are no central mechanisms for [mental health](notes/mental-health/mental-health.md) because they don't exist. Instead psychiatric symptoms have been argued that they _cause each other_. 

>  For instance, if one thinks that other people can read oneâ€™s mind (delusion), this may generate extreme suspicion (paranoia); this paranoia can lead one to avoid other people (social isolation), which, because one is no longer exposed to corrective actions of the social environment, may serve to sustain and exacerbate the relevant delusions.

In the network approach, symptoms are nodes and the causal interactions between them are the links.

# The Goal
>  ... to present a set of explanatory mechanisms that may be combined into a general framework which specifies: a) what mental disorders are, b) how they arise, and c) how they may be optimally treated.

## What are mental disorders?
>  The central tenet of the network approach is that mental disorders arise from ==the causal interaction== between symptoms in a network.
>  ... 
> the presence of a causal connection means that, if an (experimental or natural) intervention changed the state of one symptom, this would change the probability distribution of the other symptom.

## How do they arise? (emergence)
In this view mental disorders are the emergent result of strongly connected and activated symptom networks. The disorder(s) can persist long after the triggers that activated the network disappear (hysteresis). An important example is that of [PTSD](notes/mental-health/PTSD.md) in which the etiology develops and persists longer after the traumatic event has passed.

>Hysteresis: Mental disorders arise due to the presence of hysteresis in strongly connected symptom networks, which implies that symptoms continue to activate each other, even after the triggering cause of the disorder has disappeared.

Note that these mental disorder dynamics only occur in strongly connected networks since only strongly connected networks have this property of hysteresis.

> In weakly connected networks, more serious triggers can evoke strong reactions but, because the connections between the symptoms are not strong enough to render them self-sustaining, the network will gradually recover and return to its asymptomatic state.

Mental health then can be defined as the stable state of a weakly connected network. If a symptom network is strongly connected then it is susceptible to hysteresis, and thus the development of mental disorders.

It's worth noting that this definition of mental health does not mean that you are free from symptoms. Rather mental health is an equilibrium state that a healthy system returns to if perturbed. 

>  In parallel, the notion of a mental disorder itself assumes a new definition as the (alternative) stable state of a strongly connected network, i.e., the state of disorder that is separated from the healthy state by hysteresis.

Hysteresis is the mechanism that flips a strongly connected network into a self-sustaining state of disorder. This leads to an interesting definition of resilience:

>The concept of [notes/mental-health/resilience](notes/mental-health/resilience.md) can be defined as the disposition of weakly connected networks to quickly return to their stable state of mental health, and the concept of vulnerability as the disposition of strongly connected networks to transition into a state of disorder upon a perturbation in the external field.
