**meaningness:** the ambiguous quality of meaningfulness and meaninglessness that we encounter in practice. ==According to the stance that recognizes meaningness, meaning is real but not definite. It is neither objective nor subjective. It is neither given by an external force nor a human invention.==

[purpose](notes/ideas/purpose.md) is one dimension of meaningness
	- commonly lost or questioned especially at major turning points in people's lives
		-   Is there any purpose at all in living? Or is everything completely pointless?
		-   What am I supposed to do?
		-   How can I choose among the many ways I could spend the rest of my life?
		-   Does everyone’s life have the same purpose, or does everyone have their own?
		-   Where does purpose come from? Does it have some ultimate source, or is it just a personal invention?
		
five confused attitudes to purpose
	- **eternalism**: Everything has a fixed purpose, given by some sort of fundamental ordering principle of the universe. (This might be God, or Fate, or the [Cosmic Plan](https://meaningness.com/no-cosmic-plan "“Cosmic Plan” refers to any idea of an ultimate source of meaning, such as God, the Absolute, destiny, Reason, highest consciousness, or whatever.  All such ideas are inherently eternalistic. [Click for details.]"), or something.) Humans too have a specific role to play in the proper order of the universe.
		- problem is that many aspects of life don't have any purpose; eternalism fails to account for this
	- one consequence of eternalism is people fall into nihilism: the stance that nothing is meaningful, life is devoid of purpose, anything containing purpose is an illusion
	- **materialism** is the in-between stance: "The supposed cosmic purposes are doubtful at best, but obviously, people do have goals. There are human purposes no one can seriously doubt: survival, health, sex, romance, fame, power, enjoyable experiences, children, beautiful things. Realistically, those are what everyone pursues anyway. You might as well drop the hypocritical pretense of 'higher' purposes and go for what you really want."
	- **missionism**: legacy stance; serving the greater good by creating something of lasting value for others, based on your unique gift. 
		- this would be better minus the unique gift part
	- **existentialism**: Since the universe (or God) does not supply us with purposes, they are human creations. Mostly people mindlessly adopt purposes that are handed to them by society. You need to throw those off, and choose your own purposes, as an act of creative will.
		- problem is that we don't choose our purposes, at least in the way of full agency
		
resolving the confusion:
	- each stance above treats meaning as something external, something given or something to find. Nihilism denies it completely.
	- the book is an attempt to resolve the above issues.
	- it presumes that: meaning is real (and cannot be denied), but is fluid (so it cannot be fixed). It is neither objective (given by God) nor subjective (chosen by individuals).
	- "The book offers resolutions to problems of meaning that avoid denial, fixation, and the impossibility of total self-determination. These resolutions are non-obvious, and sometimes unattractive; but they are workable in ways the alternatives are not."
	
	
distinguishing between spiritual and practical suffering:

> "Mission and materialism are not the only possibilities. You can, instead, do things that you enjoy _and_ that are useful to others."

> ask instead: “But how do I know _what_ to dedicate my life to?” Wrong question… a good question to ask instead is “What is something I can do now that will be both enjoyable and useful?”

> ==“What’s something useful and enjoyable I can do now?”== prompts the answer “Who cares—so what?” Mere usefulness and enjoyability doesn’t sound _good enough_. This “[complete stance](https://meaningness.com/preview-eternalism-and-nihilism#completion "Complete stances acknowledge the nebulosity and pattern of meaningness, avoiding the errors of fixation and denial.  They are more difficult to adopt than confused stances, but are more accurate and more workable in the long run. [Click for details.]")”—of [enjoyable usefulness](https://meaningness.com/enjoyable-usefulness "Enjoyable usefulness is the stance that purposes are co-created in an appreciative, compassionate dance with the world; both mundane and higher purposes can be meaningful; you might as well find things to do that are both enjoyable for you and meaningful for others. [Click for details.]")—is emotionally unattractive at first. Once accepted, though, it does eliminate the anguish of an existential dilemma. ==If you can let go of the grandiosity that leads you to imagine that some _special task_ awaits you, _and_ the false hope that getting enough of what you want would make life satisfactory, you can be useful and enjoy yourself. That letting-go takes some doing; I will suggest ways to go about it.==

stances vs systems

> when asked our perspectives on meaning, we usually mention which system(s) we're subscribed to - e.g. Christianity, atheism, and so on
	
> though in the context of making everyday decisions, we usually approach problems of meaningness in terms of "stances" e.g. "the goal of life is to squeeze out as much pleasure as possible"
	
This book advocates a fourth combination of stances: the ones I describe as [complete](https://meaningness.com/preview-eternalism-and-nihilism#completion "Complete stances acknowledge the nebulosity and pattern of meaningness, avoiding the errors of fixation and denial.  They are more difficult to adopt than confused stances, but are more accurate and more workable in the long run. [Click for details.]").

Its typical emotional texture is appreciative curiosity.

Here’s how some complete stances align:

-   [Meaningness](https://meaningness.com/what-is-meaningness "“Meaningness” is the quality of being meaningful and/or meaningless. It has various dimensions, such as value, purpose, and significance. This book suggests that meaningness is always nebulous—ambiguous and fluid—but also always patterned. [Click for details.]"): things may be meaningful, meaningless, or may be ambiguously between. It’s worth investigating meanings, but you can’t always expect answers.
-   [Participation](https://meaningness.com/participation "Participation is the stance that there is no single right way of drawing boundaries around objects, or between self and other.  Things are connected in many different ways and to different degrees; they may also be irrelevant to each other, or to you.  Connections are formed by meaningful, on-going interaction. [Click for details.]"): there is no one right way of drawing boundaries; things can be connected in many different ways, and can also have no significant connection. Finding unexpected connections and redrawing boundaries is often valuable; so is recognizing irrelevance.
-   [Intermittently continuing](https://meaningness.com/intermittently-continuing "Intermittently continuing is the stance that selfness comes and goes, varies over time, and has no essential nature. [Click for details.]"): selfness is valuable and should not be rejected; it can usefully be explored, but it has no essential nature.
-   [Enjoyable usefulness](https://meaningness.com/enjoyable-usefulness "Enjoyable usefulness is the stance that purposes are co-created in an appreciative, compassionate dance with the world; both mundane and higher purposes can be meaningful; you might as well find things to do that are both enjoyable for you and meaningful for others.
