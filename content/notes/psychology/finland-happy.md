### Finland is the Happiest Country in the World, and the Finns Aren't Happy About It

Re: [[notes/psychology/Happiness]], I find this article ([Finland is the Happiest Country in the World, and the Finns Aren't Happy About It](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/finland-is-the-happiest-country-in-the-world-and-finns-arent-happy-about-it/)). The main point is that how you define happiness will change the rankings. Happiness in terms of ==average life satisfaction==, the Fins and other Scandanavian top the list. #flashcards

However, if it's defined as daily experience of ==positive emotions==, Finland drops down the list while Latin American countries rise to the top. This is partly because the Finns downplay and dislike displaying positive emotions. And if you define happiness as the lack of unipolar depression, Western countries like the US and the Finns fall short.

What about a sense of meaning in one's life? Again, Western countries are toward the bottom (correlated with declines in religiosity). Although a lack of meaning might not necessarily mean that one isn't experiencing daily positive emotions. I'm reminded too of Daniel Kahneman's Ted Talk on experiential happiness vs. life satisfaction. One is in the moment, while the other is a retrospective look. This sort of difference is significant. For example, it changes how important money actually is in determining happiness. In reflection, you might rate yourself as having led a happier life if you've accumulated some amount of wealth since it may be a proxy for success and impact, and therefore meaning. On a day to day basis, beyond meeting your basic needs, money probably doesn't really change the quality of your expierence and the influx of positive emotions (or lack thereof) you feel. All of these factors make the study of happiness a complicated endeavor. The author in the Finland article made a good suggestion though: countries can and should use these different metrics in determining how happy their populace is, and what might be worth investing in to improve it.

According to [ourworldindata.org](https://ourworldindata.org/mental-health), about 1 in 10 people globally (10.7%) live with some form of mental disorder. Their estimates are based on the flagship *Global Burden of Disease* study conducted by the *Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.*
