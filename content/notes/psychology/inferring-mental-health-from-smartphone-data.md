We use factors such as language, prior behavior, relationship quality, and socioeconomic status to predict mental health outcomes. these are all proxies... imperfect, but useful in some cases. claim is that digital tools can help clinicians make decisions as to how to best serve their patients. 

Feels Orwellian though, lack a imposition on one's right to privacy. Maybe this is something worth signing that away for though, and could work well if the right safeguards are in place.
