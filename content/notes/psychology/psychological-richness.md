I recently read a Twitter thread from professor Erin Westgate on the concept of psychological richness. Traditionally we think of the good life in terms of either [meaning](notes/ideas/meaning.md) or [Happiness](notes/psychology/Happiness.md) (historically eudaimonia and hedonism, respectively), though psychological richness is a distinct factor that is worth thinking about. 

> Psychologically rich lives, we argue, not only feel different from happy or meaningful lives. They are ==psychometrically distinct==, with different causes and different long-term outcomes, and can be assessed (both in the moment, and more globally) with different measures.

>What makes one more likely to lead a psychologically rich life? In obituary studies, more challenging and dramatic lives were coded as psychologically richer. 

> But it's not just bad things - it's anything new and challenging. Short excursions, study abroad, and tricky "Escape rooms" (even if you don't escape...) are all associated with increases in psychological richness. 
> 
> Why? Because they lead to a change in perspective. Take a look at this little picture of the moon on the [top]. Pretty boring, right? 
> 
> How about the one on the [bottom]?

> When we randomly assign participants to see these different images (and other, similar, pairs) we consistently find the same thing: while the figure-ground illusions (bottom) are no more enjoyable, ==the shift in visual perspective== reliably increases interest and psychological richness.

> And while challenging, novel, perspective-changing experiences increase psychological richness, some of us are more likely than others to seek such experiences out. Such as individuals who are high in Openness to Experience (the O in the OCEAN personality test). 
>   
>   And people leading rich lives think differently - more holistically, w/ greater attributional complexity and lower essentialism. They're more ==curious==. Students leading rich lives pursue more challenging courses, and are focused on learning (not grades).

>   SO. The big question (and it's an important one): Is this really all just about rich Americans (aka classic WEIRD [Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, Democratic] psychology)?
>   
>   We were worried about that. That a psychologically rich life might be only the privilege of the financially rich. We don't think that's the case. We think a rich life is open to many - that it broadens our view. Of what's possible. Of what's good. Of what counts.

> And the evidence backs us up. SES (r = .19), income (r = .12), and education (r = .08) aren't highly [correlation](notes/statistics/correlation.md) with psychological richness.
> 
> Nor is it just Americans. In the US, Germany, Norway, Portugal, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, India, and Angola, people describe their own *ideal* lives as being happy and meaningful - but also psychologically rich.
> 
> And when forced to choose, a small but steady minority of people across countries would prefer a psychologically rich life even at the expense of a happy or meaningful one. 
> 
> And, finally, when asked to imagine undoing their biggest regret, and how it would change their life...about a third of participants (in both the US & Korea) said it would have made their lives happier. A third, more meaningful. And the final third - psychologically richer.
