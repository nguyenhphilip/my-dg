title: agendaless attention
---

> My understanding of agendaless perception draws on my understanding of perception _with_ an agenda, which was [a main topic](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1207/s15516709cog1604_3) of [my work in artificial intelligence](https://metarationality.com/ken-wilber-boomeritis-artificial-intelligence). 
> 
> In a well-practiced task, you know [what to look for where](https://metarationality.com/perception), because you know what the things you see mean. This can be verified with gaze tracking: experimental subjects focus their attention tightly in predictable, task-relevant places.
> 
> This makes me think about the ethics of classifying things, and in general the impact of trying to classify everything on society and culture
> 
> it seems like when we attempt to do so, we inevitably strip things of their wonder if we forget that there may be other ways of looking at the thing you are classifying
> 
> classification may provide hints at the experience and essence of a thing, but it is not the thing itself
