### How to Live - Be independent

> Don’t believe anything anyone says.  
Listen if you want, but always decide for yourself.  
Never agree with anything the same day you hear it, because some ideas are persuasively hypnotic.  
Wait a few days to decide what you really think.  
Don’t let ideas into your head or heart without your permission.

> When you say you want more freedom from the world, you may just need freedom from your past self.  
You don’t see things as they are.  
You see them as you are.  
Change yourself and you change the world.
