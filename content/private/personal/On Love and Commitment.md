Relationships are often portrayed as movie moments and tacky polaroid shots hanging from the walls of a New York City flat. Yet as anyone who has loved and been loved can attest, these snapshots capture only the surface. What's tucked away in the subtitles is the work, the cycles rupture and repair, the boring and ordinary messiness involved in building an intimate existence with another.

How C and I met really was like something out of a movie. We joked about it a lot and are still amazed by how it happened. So it surprised me when I started feeling ambivalent toward the affection she was giving me. Something about my reaction felt familiar, but I didn't know why. 

This led to doubts about the relationship, and continues to do so. 

I was confused and hurting because I loved her deeply, but there was a familiar taste to my disturbing thoughts. For a week I couldn't let them go, they consumed my every waking hour and , which nearly led to a premature breakup. 

(from changing my the theme and appearance of my blog instead of writing more content and taking the substance more seriously; dropping otu of grad school; past relationships; projects that began as exciting but soon quit thereafter once they got hard or boring)

My friend S, I realized that I was playing out a script, an engrained pattern: I had a tendency to quit things when they required commitment. From parts of our conversation (... indicates bits omitted for clarity):

> ...
> 
> S: Maybe “self-destructive” isn’t the appropriate term because it’s awfully derogatory. What I can say, however, is that I’ve noticed how **you question your happiness when you have it**. (I just got your quitter/novelty seeker message at this moment and boy, you make me laugh SO much.) **You work incredibly hard for your goals and when you have it, you find a trivial reason to say, “Nope! This isn’t IT.”**
> 
> ...
> 
> Phil: I **feel like there’s an element of control to it, like I get to choose what happens to the story rather than bear the unintended consequences of sticking with it, like disappointment with the result, or fear of wasting time**, FOMO.

But why? S, again:

> **S**: **...My intuition is that all of this is truly fear-based. Naturally, you thrive in the unknown: changing circumstances, transitions, places of instability. It’s truly your place because you’re so good at it. It brings out all the good things about you — your flexibility, your fleeting soul, your ability to morph and change to meet your new environment, your openness. It’s also exciting for you.**
> 
> ...
> 
> **S**: Ok, back to the point — Have you considered though… how the place of uncertainty is very much your comfort zone? It’s the place where you just don’t know so… **you’re not truly invested in your relationship. You don’t have high stakes and you don’t get your heart too broken. The downside of this is you get into these bouts where you become unsettled and unhappy WHILE IN seemingly happy/healthy situations. As soon as a routine comes in place, you react by finding something wrong with it. Then you plan your exit strategy. Then you leave. Then you repeat it all over again.**

This made sense, given the shape of my life experiences. The uncertainties I had faced thus far as an adult were contained by short time spans and tamable parameters, ones I could set and mostly control. The temporary jobs and homes, the numerous dates, walking the Camino de Santiago: I learned and grew a lot through these experiences, but I hadn't yet allowed myself to tussle with the unknowns of any long-term commitments. I much preferred the familiar uncertainties of novel situations because I could always choose to float from one to the next, like a bee with no hive. But a lack of commitment is itself a commitment to fear. 

To do the opposite then is to choose to deeply commit to something. It requires one to double down on what's in front of them even when the possibility of heartbreak is on the horizon – and it alway is, in a life authentically lived. David Whyte, from Consolations:

> Heartbreak is an indication of our sincerity: in a love relationship, in a life's work, in trying to learn a musical instrument, in the attempt to shape a better more generous self. Heartbreak is the beautifully helpless side of love and affection and is just as much an essence and emblem of care as the spiritual athlete's quick but abstract ability to let go. Heartbreak has its own way of inhabiting time and its own beautiful and trying patience in coming and going.

> [It] may be the very essence of being human, of being on the journey from here to there, and of coming to care deeply for what we find along the way.

Committing – to a work, to a place, to a life, to another – that *is* love. 

there's knowledge now. we see each other more clearly and realize that there is still so much to learn about one another. This requires a sort of daily recommitment, in small and large ways. This time it was large, the result of my own issues. That's what love is. Choosing to stay in and continue playing the game.

We tend to see the end products of love and writing. They're portrayed in perfect form on the screen, off the page. And yet what led up to that point is often messier, and to me, more beautiful. It's the effort that attracts me, in two people trying to reconcile their differences to make things work, in coming to terms with their past for the present, a past that stirs and haunts if left to its devices.

Perhaps it's an image thing. I want to be seen as interesting, and the longer she gets to know me, the more mundane I get. That's partly why I live in books and ideas – I genuinely enjoy it, and yet there is something lost when I spend too much time bound by them. It's the specialness of the ordinary, of having someone to love and spend time with, 

In love we need to see past the stories and observe what is present. Sometimes I do feel alone when she doesn't play along with the ideas I share, and I'm sure she does too when a pop culture or movie reference is lost on me. 

Real love is not a performance.


Loving and building a relationship with C meant committing to something that was laden with the possibility of heartbreak, disappointment, and misunderstanding. I handled that in the past by running, by retreating to the only thing I had certainty in: myself. 

> **S**: I can’t be sure if Caitlyn is the person for you. I’m not sure you’ll know that just yet. **But what I can say is that you have a habit of leaving** which reminds me of my love story with P. When I was 5 months into dating P, I had this yearning to burn it all down for absolutely no good reason. My exit strategy was to study abroad. I was oscillating between staying and building this beautiful relationship with P OR just going and leaving like I always do. I begged the universe for signs like a crazy person. Ultimately, I chose to stay and built my relationship with P because it was the harder choice. Hard because it was outside of my comfort zone. Younger me would have just left and repeated the cycle. But at the time I was making that choice, I was self-actualized enough to also acknowledge I had an unhealthy behavior of self-sabotaging my own happiness. I had a chance to break that cycle and I chose it. To this day, I do still wonder who I could have been or could have done had I left. BUT that evil, little inkling of hesitation/“what if” is normal. It’s human. It’s FOMO. I am, however, certain that if I never pursued and grew this relationship with P, that would have been an even greater regret.  

Thankfully, I had a huge moment of clarity:

> 
> **Phil:** You saying that makes me instantly realize I would regret not trying this with Caitlyn.

I chose to love.

(Side note: everyone needs a friend like S. Someone who isn't afraid to point out your flaws, in a kind and constructive way. It makes life exciting because you're growing in the most important and memorable way – that is, by making mistakes through living fully, and becoming better as you go.)
