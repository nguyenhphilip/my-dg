Birthdays are personal landmarks. They remind us of where we've been, where we currently stand, and where we've still yet to go. We have more of them to look forward to nowadays, but we're also terrible procrastinators who have a tendency to squanderÂ  the time given to us. We stretch our tasks and to-do lists to fill the available space, the seeming extra years, believing that the hands of a clock and the cards you were dealt are more flexible and generous than they are. Tolerated are the demands of some overweight corporate bigwig who has been spoonfed the idea of retirement his entire life, who is selling that same narrative to you now, while redlining your dreams until further notice.


dreams are redlined until further notice

We think it stretches more than it does and use it not for ourselves but to appease the demands of others. We put our dreams on hold believing that all of the waiting and saving and sacrifice will amount to something close to happiness, somewhere in the future. 70's the new 50 and 50's the new 30 they say. But no one's asking who 'they' are. We have more time, but more time for what? Why should I wait for 50 to be 30? I want to be 30 while I'm 30. I want to be 50 when I'm 50. I want age not to be counted by the number of wrinkles but by the measure of my days. 

Birthdays are usually adorned by gifts, but who's giving you more time? That's something only you can give to yourself. 

Go after the life you want, without squandering the gift of your birthday, the gift of getting to live another year on this Earth.
