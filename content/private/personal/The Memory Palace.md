# The Memory Palace

Memories are fleeting things, decaying pages in a loose book spine subject to the whims of time. One tug is enough to pull them from place, like a child snatching a flower from its roots. Displaced, ever-changing, mutable.

A man afraid of changing memories of the past. He records them then immediately tries to find a new experience. He’s always moving forward, always a full to-do list. Fails to enjoy the present, doesn’t look back, always integrating.

Share my own stories. Stories from a simple life.

My first job out of college; Kelsey and winning a trip to New York.

A spontaneous trip to Germany.

Walking in Spain.

Meeting Caitlyn.

The Mathematician. The neuroscientist. The child.

Finn was eight years old when he first realized it was possible to forget a memory. He was coming home from school, and as a game he decided to quiz his parents

“Mama, what did the cake taste like?”
