### How to Live - Follow the Great Book
You don’t lack direction.  
You have too many directions.  
An open mind, like an open mouth, needs to eventually close on something.  
Stop swerving and chasing new leaders.  
Stay on a single steady path.  
Following your book is how to live.

“Follow your passion” is terrible advice.  
Fleeting interests are a bad compass.  
Passions pass so quickly that to follow them would have you dashing around like a dog chasing bubbles.

Don’t follow your heart.  
Your heart has been hacked.  
Your intuition is usually wrong because it’s just emotion, subliminally influenced by amoral inputs.  
Emotions are a wild animal.  
You need rules to tame them.

Rules give you freedom from your desires.  
When you rise above your instincts, you still feel them but no longer do what they say.  
Following your emotions is not freedom.  
Being free from following emotions is freedom.

When you stop following emotions, and just do what’s right, then you’ll finally get what you always wanted.  
It was the emotions that were distracting you all along.

So what’s the right thing to do?  
An action with good results?  
An action that feels good?  
No.  
The action prescribed by your book.  
No need to judge or decide.  
Just follow the rules and trust the path.

Rules must be absolutely unbreakable.  
If you try to decide, each time, whether it’s OK to break the rule or not, then you’ve missed the whole point of rules.  
Rules are to save you from deciding.  
That’s why hard rules are easier to keep.

Discipline turns intentions into action.  
Discipline means no procrastination.  
Discipline means now.  
Choose the pain of discipline, not the pain of regret.

An undisciplined moment seems harmless, but they add up to disaster.  
Without discipline, the tiny things in life will be your downfall.

Self-control is always rewarding.  
Self-control is always the right thing to do.  
This is a universal law.  
Your self-control is highest in the morning and diminishes during the day, so review your book’s rules every afternoon.

Physical discipline helps mental discipline.  
Align your outer self with your inner self.  
Cleaning your house helps clean your mind.

Discipline gets you to your destination.  
Without it, you’re led astray by everyone else.  
If you don’t obey your constraints, persuasive people and technology will pull you their way.

People beg you to bend your rules to fit their agenda.  
So blame your book when you refuse.  
Saying “the book says so” helps your burden of responsibility.  
If someone challenges your choices or asks you to explain, just say “the book says so” and carry on without the exhausting debate.

Some people may surpass you by breaking the rules.  
But remember: the miserable, broken, destitute people in the world are the other outcome of breaking the rules.  
Many more fail than succeed.  
Rules may keep you from some stupendous heights, but they will always keep you from falling too low.

Define a good life as more than shallow pleasure.  
A good life is contribution.  
A good life is resisting temptation.  
A good life is being the best you can be.  
A good life is diligently following your book.
